## If you forgot your password

If you don’t remember your Notion password, you can reset it. To do so:

1. Go to [notion.so/login](https://www.notion.com/login) in your web browser.

2. Select `Forgot password?`, enter your email address, then select `Send reset link`.

3. We'll send a link to your email address. Open the link to be taken to `Settings` in your Notion workspace, where you can set a new password.

   * If you do not set a new password at this point, your password will simply be removed and you can log in using temporary codes.

4. Log in again.

## If you lost access to your email

If you no longer have access to the email address you used to sign up for Notion, you can change this email in Notion settings. You’ll need to have a permanent password for your account already. To do so:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar → `{your name}`.

2. Under `Account security`, select `Change email`.

3. Enter your password, then select `Continue`.

4. Enter your new email, then select `Send verification code`. Once you receive this code at your new email address, enter it.

5. Select `Change email`.

6. Log in again.
