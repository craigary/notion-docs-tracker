## Create a timeline

Timelines show the progress of your project over time so you can make sure things are happening when they should.

Want to track your database’s events with the rest of your appointments, meetings, and plans? You can add your Notion database to Notion Calendar so you can see all your important dates in one place! You can even update your database dates directly from Notion Calendar. [Learn more about how to do this here →](https://www.notion.com/help/use-notion-calendar-with-notion)

Here's how to to add a timeline to Notion:

1. Create a new page in your workspace.

2. Under `Get started with`, click the `•••` and then `Timeline`.

If you want to create an inline timeline, type `/Timeline view` on any page and press `enter`.

### Add timeline view to a database

Add a timeline to an existing database to view its data in that format. [More on views here →](https://www.notion.com/help/views-filters-and-sorts)

1. Click `+` next to the name of your database or the name of your current database view.

2. Select `Timeline` from the dropdown menu.

**Note:** Timelines only work if you have at least one date property in your database containing a range of dates. Otherwise nothing will be plotted.

## Customize your timeline

Edit your timeline so it does the job you need it to do. There are several ways to change the appearance of your timeline and the projects you plot on it however is most helpful to you.

### Adjust timeframe

You can view your projects on any time scale, from hours all the way up to years.

1. On the right side of your timeline, to the left of `Today`, you'll see a dropdown menu with a unit of time.

   * Your timeline will automatically adjust to show your current projects rendered on the new time scale.

### Adjust project length

1. Hover over the left or right edge of any project. Your cursor will indicate that you can drag and drop each edge to make it as long or short as you want it to be.

   * You'll see date indicators appear to guide you.

**Note:** You'll see small arrows appear on each row of your timeline to indicate that a project has occurred before or after your current view, or included scope before or after. You can click on these arrows to jump right to the project.

### Come back to today

At any time, you can jump to the current day on your timeline. Just click `Today` on the right side of the timeline.

### Show or hide table

In Notion, you can show a table to the left of your timeline so you can always see a full list of your projects no matter when they are scheduled.

To show or hide table in any timeline, click the `>>` or `<<` on the left.

### Limit projects displayed

Depending on how many projects you have in a timeline, and what you're using the timeline for, you may want to only see 10 project pages at a time, or many more. To set your preference:

1. Open the settings menu at the top right of your database → `Layout`.

2. Select `Load limit` and select a number of pages.

### Show or hide properties

Timelines give you a few ways to display properties at a glance so you can see information about your projects right away. <!-- -->To show or hide properties in your timeline:

1. Open the settings menu at the top right of your database → `Property visibility`.

2. Select `👁️` next to properties to show or hide them.

3. Use `⋮⋮` to drag your properties in the order in which you want them to be displayed in your timeline.

If you have a table open in your timeline view, you can also show properties in that table. To do this:

1. Open the settings menu at the top right of your database → `Layout` → `Table properties`.

2. Select `👁️` next to properties to show or hide them.

3. Use `⋮⋮` to drag your properties in the order in which you want them to be displayed in your table.

### Rearrange timeline

To reorder items in your timeline, click and drag any timeline item up or down. If you have a table open next to your timeline, you can click and drag columns in that table to reorder them.

### Plot by a different set of dates

If you have multiple date properties in your database, you can plot your projects on your timeline using any of them. It’s also easy to switch between them.

For example, you might have one date property for project work and another for the time needed to prep launch. To show the one that you want:

1. Open the settings menu at the top right of your database → `Layout` → `Show timeline by`.

2. Choose which date property you want your timeline to show.

   * You can choose to have start and end dates as separate properties that dictate how your projects or plotted. You can turn that on in this menu. Or you can have the date range you want to plot exist in the same date property.

### Calculations

When you have a table open in timeline view, you can run calculations that will show you information about the data contained in each of the table’s columns.

Depending on the type of property you’re running a calculation on, you’ll see some or all of the following calculation options:

* `Count all`: Gives you the total number of rows in the column.

* `Count empty`: Counts the number of rows that do not have a value in the column.

* `Count not empty`: Counts the number of rows where the column is filled. 

* `Count values`: Counts the number of property values contained in the column. 

* `Count unique values`: Counts the number of unique property values contained in the column, omitting duplicates. 

* `Percent empty`: Gives you the percentage of rows that do not have the chosen property filled in. 

* `Percent not empty`: Gives you the percentage of cards that do have the property filled in. 

* `Earliest date`: If you have time-related properties in your table like `Last edited` or `Created time`, you can choose to show when the oldest row was edited or created.

* `Latest date`: Shows when the newest row was last edited or created.

* `Date range`: Shows you the time gap between the oldest and newest edit or creation time.

* If you have a `Number` property in your table, you unlock several other calculation options:

  * `Sum`: Shows the sum of the numbers in the column.

  * `Average`: Shows the average of the numbers in the column.

  * `Median`: Shows the median of the numbers in the column.

  * `Min`: Shows the lowest number in the column.

  * `Max`: Shows the highest number in the column.

  * `Range`: Subtracts the lowest number from the highest.

To run a calculation on a property:

1. Click on a property in your table.

2. In the menu that appears, hover over `Calculate`. Select from one of the calculation options.

## FAQs

### Is there a way to add conditional formatting? Like change the color of projects plotted on my timeline or background color of cells in the table?

Yes! Learn more about conditional color [here →](https://www.notion.com/help/database-properties#conditional-color)


### Why can't I delete the Name property when showing table in my timeline?

Timelines are essentially databases, and databases are essentially lists of items. That's what goes in the `Name` property. All the other data points contained are attributes of these items, like due dates, owners, tags and more. You can't remove the `Name` property because that's the core information contained. You can, however, rename that property to align with whatever you are working on.


### I don’t want my database pages to open on the side or in the center of my page. Is there anyway to open a database page in full-screen by default?

Yes! To do this:

1. Open the settings menu at the top of your database.

2. Select `Layout` → `Open pages in` → `Full page`.


### Does Notion have simple (non-database) tables?

Yes! [Learn more about simple tables here →](https://www.notion.com/help/columns-headings-and-dividers#simple-tables)


### How can I turn a full-page database into an inline database, or vice versa?

To change a full-page database into an inline database:

1. Drag the full-page database from your sidebar into another page. It will become a sub-page of that page.

2. Open the parent page, click the **`⋮⋮`** button next to the database sub-page, and select `Turn into inline`.

To change an inline database to a full-page database, drag an inline database block into your sidebar as a top-level page.
