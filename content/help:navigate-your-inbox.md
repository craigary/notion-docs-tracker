## Sidebar

Notion Mail‚Äôs left-hand sidebar is where you can find all of the ways your mail is organized. At the top of the sidebar, you‚Äôll see the following:

* Your name ‚Äî click on it to access your `Settings`, switch accounts, or log out.

* `üìù`, which you can click to start a new email. Learn more about composing emails [here ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/compose-an-email)

## Views

The first section you‚Äôll see in your sidebar is a `Views` section. Simply put, views are ways of organizing your emails in ways that are most helpful to you.

When you get started with Notion Mail, you‚Äôll see some views already in your sidebar. As you create more views, you‚Äôll see them in the `Views` sidebar section. Ready to create your own view? Dive into views in [this article ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/views-groups-filters-and-properties)

## Mail

The Mail section of your sidebar contains the following folders:

* `All Mail`: This is where all of your mail lives, including your archived emails.

* `Sent`: This is where all of your sent emails are.

* `Drafts`: This is where you can find all your drafted emails.

* `Trash`: This is where your deleted emails are.

**Note:** At this time, there's no way to see all of the emails across your various Notion Mail accounts. We also don't currently support delegated mailboxes.

## Reading emails

There are three ways to read emails in Notion Mail. You can adjust this by going to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Thread style`. From here, you can select one of the following options:

* `Side peek`: When you click on an email, it‚Äôll open up on the right side of your screen. You can adjust the width of the page using click and drag.

* `Center peek`: When you click on an email, it‚Äôll open up in the middle of your screen.

* `Full page`: When you click on an email, it‚Äôll open up as a full page.

You can take the following actions when you have an email open:

* `üïò`: Remind yourself to come back to the email at a certain date and time.

* `Mark unread`.

* `Label`.

* `Archive`.

* `üóëÔ∏è`: Move the email to the trash.

* Open the `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` menu to `Mark as spam` or `Report phishing`.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x41;t this time, you can‚Äôt download your email as a PDF or turn your email into a Notion page.
