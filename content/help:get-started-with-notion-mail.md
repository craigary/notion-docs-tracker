## Gmail and Notion Mail sync

Notion Mail utilizes most of the features you’re familiar with from Gmail, like your labels, categories (like promotions), and contacts. The sync between Gmail and Notion Mail happens in real time, but there are a few things that aren’t synced from Gmail to Notion Mail:

* Blocked senders

* Snoozed emails

* Scheduled emails

* Drafts

* Spam emails (upon initial sync)

  * Following the initial sync, any emails you mark as spam in Notion Mail will also reflect as spam in Gmail, and vice versa.

Also note the following:

* Individual emails that have been deleted won’t be synced. For example, if you delete a single email within a thread in Gmail, that email won’t be deleted in Notion Mail. Syncing happens at the thread level, so only complete threads that are deleted will reflect in Notion Mail and Gmail.

* When you change a label name in Gmail after your initial sync with Notion Mail, the new label name won’t reflect in Notion Mail.

  * However, you can change a label name in Notion Mail and it will reflect in Gmail.

* When you create a new label in Notion, it may not render properly in Gmail.

* The status and number of unread emails may vary slightly between your Notion Mail and Gmail accounts, depending on how you’ve configured your inbox.

**Note:** For the following features, you'll need to go to Gmail to make any changes:

* Signature

* Auto-reply
