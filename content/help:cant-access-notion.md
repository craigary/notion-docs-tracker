If Notion is down or you’re unable to access Notion:

* Check our [status page](https://status.notion.so/) and [X](https://twitter.com/NotionStatus) for live updates on any known issues.

* Try disabling any firewalls, VPNs, or privacy or security software you have on your device that may be blocking access to Notion.

* Check for any ISPs blocking the .so or notion.so domain.

* See if the issue is with your DNS. Changing your DNS to a public one like 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1 might resolve the issue. You can learn more about how to do this [here →](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using)

* Try a different browser, device, or platform. For example, if you’re using Notion’s desktop app, see if the issue persists when you use Notion in your browser.
