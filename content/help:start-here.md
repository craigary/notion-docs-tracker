We like to describe Notion as a set of building blocks for creating things you love to use on your computer, such as:

* Documents

* Databases

* Public websites

* Knowledge bases

* Project management systems

* The world's most beautiful notes... 😉

Notion is different from other software in a few ways. And once you master these basics, you can pretty much build whatever you want.

Most importantly, don't worry about not knowing everything you can do right away. We'll discover it together. Read on to dive right in!
