To set up provisioning with [SCIM](https://www.notion.com/help/provision-users-and-groups-with-scim) in Notion, youâ€™ll first need to make sure that your Identity Provider, or IdP, supports the SAML 2.0 protocol. Here are some app-specific instructions for setting up your IdP.

## Azure

Notionâ€™s Azure SCIM integration supports the following provisioning features:

* Creating users.

* Removing users.

* Keeping user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Notion.

* Provisioning groups and group memberships in Notion.

* [Single sign-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/notion-tutorial) to Notion (recommended).

### Step 1: Configure user provisioning in Notion

Start by configuring Notion to support provisioning with Azure AD. To do this:

1. Go to notion.com/settings/organization.

2. Go to the `General` tab and select `SCIM provisioning`.

3. Copy an existing token or select `Add token` to create a new token.

   * Notionâ€™s SCIM tenant URL is [https://www.notion.so/scim/v2](https://www.notion.com/scim/v2), which youâ€™ll use later.

### Step 2: Add Notion from the Azure AD application gallery

Next, youâ€™ll want to add Notion from the Azure AD application gallery following [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal).

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user or group.

If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app **based on assignment**, you can use the following [steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal) to assign users and groups to the application.

If you choose to scope who will be provisioned **based solely on attributes of the user or group**, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).

### Step 3: Configure automatic user provisioning to Notion

To configure user provisioning in Azure:

1. Sign in to theÂ [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. SelectÂ `Enterprise Applications` â†’ `All applications`.

3. In the applications list, selectÂ `Notion`**.**

4. Select theÂ `Provisioning`**&#x20;**&#x74;ab.

5. Set theÂ `Provisioning Mode`**&#x20;**&#x74;oÂ `Automatic`.

6. Under theÂ `Admin Credentials`**&#x20;**&#x73;ection, input your Notion Tenant URL and Secret Token. ClickÂ `Test Connection`**&#x20;**&#x74;o ensure Azure AD can connect to Notion. If the connection fails, ensure your Notion account has Admin permissions and try again.

7. SelectÂ `Save`.

8. Under theÂ `Mappings`Â section, selectÂ `Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Notion`.

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Notion in theÂ `Attribute-Mapping`Â section.

10. Select `Save` to commit any changes.

11. Under theÂ `Mappings`Â section, selectÂ `Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Notion`.

12. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Notion in theÂ `Attribute-Mapping`Â section.

13. Select `Save` to commit any changes.

14. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Notion, change theÂ `Provisioning Status`Â toÂ `On`Â in theÂ `Settings`Â section.

15. Define the users and groups that you would like to provision to Notion by choosing the desired values inÂ `Scope`Â in theÂ `Settings`Â section.

16. When you're ready to provision, clickÂ `Save`.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x54;his operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined inÂ `Scope`Â in theÂ `Settings`Â section.

The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running.

3. Copy an existing token or select `Add token` to create a new token.

### Step 2: Configure provisioning in Google

To configure user provisioning in Google:

1. Make sure youâ€™re [signed into an administrator account](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182076) to ensure your user account has the appropriate permissions.

2. Continue the steps shown on [Google Workspace Admin Help](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13063106#zippy=%2Cset-up-auto-provisioning-for-the-notion-application) starting at "Set up auto-provisioning forÂ the Notion application".

**Note:&#x20;**&#x47;oogleâ€™s SCIM integration does not support group provisioning and de-provisioning.

## Okta

Notion's Okta SCIM integration supports the following provisioning features:

* Creating users.

* Updating user attributes, if the user has an email domain belonging to your organization.

   * The `Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL` needs to be entered in your Identity Provider (IdP) portal.

   * The `Identity Provider Details` is a field in which you need to provide either an IdP URL or IdP metadata XML.

5. Go to the `General` tab and select `SCIM provisioning`.

6. Copy an existing token or select `Add token` to create a new token.

### Step 2: Configure user provisioning in Okta

To configure user provisioning in Okta:

1. Add theÂ Notion app from [Okta's integration catalog](https://www.okta.com/integrations/notion/).

2. In the `Sign-on Options` view, select `Email` for the `Application username` format on the `Sign On application` tab.

3. Under the `Provisioning` tab, select `Configure API integration`, and click on the `Enable API integration`**&#x20;**&#x63;heckbo&#x78;**.**

4. Enter the Notion SCIM API token you copied in Step 1 into the `API Token` text box, and select `Save`**.**

5. Click `Edit` next to `Provisioning to App`, and enable your preferred features (`Create users`, `Update user attributes`, or `Deactivate users`.

6. Click `Save`**.**

7. After setting up the API integration, open the `Push Groups` tab, and add the Okta groups you want to sync with Notion from the `Push Groups` button.

**Note:** When updating users/groups via an existing SCIM configuration, pleaseÂ do notÂ delete the Notion App from Okta. Doing so will remove all provisioned users from the workspace.

## OneLogin

**Note:** If you plan to provision users to Notion via OneLogin, itâ€™s important to configure SCIM before configuring [SSO](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-saml-sso#onelogin).

Notionâ€™s OneLogin SCIM integration supports the following provisioning features:

* Creating users.

* Updating user attributes, if the user has an email domain belonging to your organization.

* Deactivating users, which removes them from your workspace.

* Creating rules to map OneLogin roles with permission groups in Notion.

### Step 1: Configure user provisioning in Notion

To configure user provisioning in Notion:

1. Go to notion.com/settings/organization.

2. Go to the `General` tab.

   * The `Identity Provider Details` is a field in which you need to provide either an IdP URL or IdP metadata XML.

5. Go to the `General` tab and select `SCIM provisioning`.

6. Copy an existing token or select `Add token` to create a new token.

**Note:** Workspace owners can only copy and use tokens that they themselves have generated. If a token has already been created by another workspace owner, you can coordinate to determine if another token is necessary. All tokens will expire once the workspace owner that generated the token leaves the workspace or is downgraded to a member.

### Step 2: Configure provisioning in OneLogin
