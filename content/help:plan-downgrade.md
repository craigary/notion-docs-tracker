## Downgrade your plan

As your needs change, you might want to downgrade your Notion plan. To do this:

1. In your sidebar, click `Settings` → `Billing` → `Change plan`.

2. Select the plan you want to change to, then click `Continue`.

3. Provide some feedback for us, then click `Downgrade`.

4. You’ll receive confirmation of your downgrade, and see when your current plan ends.
