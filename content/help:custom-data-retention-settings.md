## Page deletion

Users can [delete](https://www.notion.com/help/duplicate-delete-and-restore-content#delete-pages) any pages that they have edit or full access to. They can also restore or remove those pages from Trash.

As an Enterprise workspace owner, you can decide how long a page stays in Trash before it’s permanently deleted and no longer accessible to users. To do this:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Select `Security`.

3. Open the `Data retention` tab.

4. You’ll see the current setting for when pages in Trash will be deleted. By default, this is 30 days. Select `Change` to customize it.

5. Set a custom time period between one day and 10 years. Your time period can be set in days or years.

6. Once you’re done, select `Save`.

When users in your workspace navigate to Trash in the sidebar, they’ll be able to see how long pages have before they’re deleted from Trash.

## Page retention

Only Enterprise workspace owners can view and restore pages after they’ve been permanently deleted from Trash. To set the length of this retention period:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Select `Security`.

3. Open the `Data retention` tab.

4. You’ll see the current setting for how long pages will be retained. By default, this is 30 days. Select `Change` to customize it.

5. Set a custom time period between one day and 10 years. Your time period can be set in days or years.

6. Once you’re done, select `Save`.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x4F;nce a page is permanently deleted by you or automatically following the retention period, workspace owners will also be unable to access or restore it.

## Search deleted and retained pages

Enterprise workspace owners can utilize [content search](https://www.notion.com/help/admin-content-search) to find both pages in Trash as well as pages that have been retained, or in other words have been deleted from Trash but are still retained in accordance with their workspace’s retention settings. To use content search to find deleted and retained pages:

1. Select `Settings` in the sidebar → `Content search`.

2. Use the `Page status` filter and select `In Trash` or `Retained pages`. Add any additional filters you’d like; you can learn more about these [here →](https://www.notion.com/help/admin-content-search)
