These are instructions for setting up Notion [SAML SSO](https://www.notion.com/help/saml-sso-configuration) with Entra ID (formerly Azure), Google, Okta, and OneLogin. If you use a different Identity Provider and need assistance with configuration, please let us know.

**Note:** At this time, organizations on the Enterprise Plan can only set up SAML SSO with one IdP.

## Entra ID

### Step 1: Create a new application integration

To create a new application integration in Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the Entra ID portal. On the left navigation pane, select theÂ `Azure Active Directory`Â service.

2. Navigate toÂ `Enterprise Applications`Â and then selectÂ `All Applications`.

3. To add a new application, selectÂ `New application`.

4. In theÂ `Add` from the galleryÂ section, typeÂ `Notion`Â in the search box. SelectÂ NotionÂ from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

### Step 2:Â Create SAML Integration

To set up the SAML integration:

1. In the Azure portal, on theÂ NotionÂ application integration page, find theÂ `Manage`Â section and selec&#x74;**&#xA0;**`Single sign-on`.

2. On theÂ `Select a single sign-on method`Â page, selectÂ `SAML`.

### Step 3: SAML settings

To configure SAML settings in Notion:

1. In Notion, go to `Settings` â†’ `General` if youâ€™re on the Business Plan, or the `General` tab of your [organization settings](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls) if youâ€™re on the Enterprise Plan.

2. In theÂ `Allowed email domains`Â section, remove all email domains.

3. Select the `Identity` tab in `Settings` if you're on the Business Plan, or go to your organization settings â†’ `General` â†’ `SAML Single sign-on (SSO)` if you're on the Enterprise Plan.

4. Verify one or more domains. See instructions for domain verification [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/domain-management#verify-a-domain-for-your-workspace)

5. Toggle onÂ `Enable SAML SSO`. TheÂ `SAML SSO Configuration`Â modal will automatically appear and prompt you to complete the set-up.

6. The SAML SSO Configuration modal is divided into two parts:

   * The `Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL` needs to be entered in your Identity Provider (IdP) portal.

   * The `Identity Provider Details` is a field in which you need to provide either an IdP URL or IdP metadata XML.

### Step 4: Configure Notion in Entra ID

To set up in Notion in Entra ID:

1. On theÂ set up single sign-on with SAMLÂ page, click the pencil icon forÂ `Basic SAML Configuration`Â to edit the settings.

## Custom SAML SSO configuration

If you don't use one of Notionâ€™s supported SAML providers, you can also configure your IdP to use SAML with Notion.

### Step 1: Set up your IdP

Your IdP must support the SAML 2.0 spec to be used with Notion. To set up your IdP:

1. Configure the ACS URL to the value Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL from Notion. You can find this in `Settings` â†’ `Identity & Provisioning` â†’ `Edit SAML SSO Configuration`.

2. Configure `NameID` to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`.

   1. Similarly, configure `username` to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`.

3. Configure `EntityID` to [https://notion.so/sso/saml](https://stg.notion.so/sso/saml). You can find this in `Settings` â†’ the bottom of `Identity & Provisioning`.

4. Configure the following attributes:

   * `emailAddress`: This is a user's email address. Most IdPs set this by default.

   * (Optional) `firstName`

   * (Optional) `lastName`

   * (Optional) `profilePicture`

5. Copy the IdP metadata URL or IdP metadata XML for next steps.

### Step 2: Set up SAML in Notion

To set up SAML in Notion:

1. In Notion, go to `Settings` â†’ `General` if youâ€™re on the Business Plan, or the `General` tab of your [organization settings](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls) if youâ€™re on the Enterprise Plan.

2. In the `Allowed email domains`**&#x20;**&#x73;ection, add new email domains and follow the prompts to verify them. These must be email domains of your users logging into Notion.

3. Select the `Identity` tab in `Settings` if you're on the Business Plan, or go to your organization settings â†’ `General` â†’ `SAML Single sign-on (SSO)` if you're on the Enterprise Plan.

4. InÂ `SAML Single sign-on (SSO)`**&#xA0;**&#x73;ettings, toggleÂ `Enable SAML SSO`Â on. This will open theÂ SAML SSO Configuratio&#x6E;**&#xA0;**&#x64;ialog.

5. UnderÂ `Identity Provider Details`, input the IdP metadata URL or IdP metadata XML from your IdP.

6. Make sure you provide your desired inputs for `Login method`,Â `Automatic account creation`, and `Linked workspaces`.

## Switch identity providers

To switch identity providers:

1. In Notion, go to `Settings` â†’ `General` if youâ€™re on the Business Plan, or the `General` tab of your [organization settings](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls) if youâ€™re on the Enterprise Plan.

2. Select the `Identity` tab in `Settings` if you're on the Business Plan, or go to your organization settings â†’ `General` â†’ `SAML Single sign-on (SSO)` if you're on the Enterprise Plan.

3. Enter your new information, then select `Save changes`.

When switching to a new IdP, we recommend that:

* SSO not be enforced during the transition, so you can minimize the risk of locking users out.

* Email addresses for the users under your new IdP match the userâ€™s email in Notion.

**Note**: Changing identity providers does not end user sessions or deactivate users.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors when setting up SAML SSO, check to make sure your IdP's metadata, SAML requests and responses are valid XML against the SAML XSD schemas. You can do so using [this online tool](https://www.samltool.com/validate_xml.php).

Note that we do not support the `EntitiesDescriptor` element. If your IdP's metadata contains this element, extract the contained `EntityDescriptor` element and try again.

## FAQs

### Are profile photos transmitted to Notion from the IdP?

Yes, profilePhoto is an optional custom attribute. You may assign this attribute to a corresponding attribute in your IdP, provided the attribute contains the URL to an image. If the profilePhoto field is set, this image will replace the avatar in Notion when the user signs in using SAML SSO.


### Can I still log in to Notion if my Identity Provider (IdP) is out of service?

Yes, even with SAML enforced, workspace owners have the option to log in with email. A workspace owner can change the SAML configuration to disable `Enforce SAML` so users can log in with email again.
