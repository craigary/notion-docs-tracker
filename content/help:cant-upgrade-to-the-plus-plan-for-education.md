## Downgrade to the Free Plan first

If youâ€™re already subscribed to a paid Notion plan, youâ€™ll need to [downgrade](https://www.notion.com/help/upgrade-or-downgrade-your-plan#downgrade-your-plan) to the Free Plan first in order to see the option to upgrade to the Plus Plan for students and educators. The upgrade option will appear **only after** the plan has been fully downgraded to the Free Plan.

## Make sure your educational email address is tied to your Notion account

Your account might not be tied to a valid educational email address. Make sure you [change your account email](https://www.notion.com/help/account-settings#account-security-settings) to your educational email.

## Remove any other workspace members

Your workspace might have multiple workspace owners or members. The Plus Plan for individual students and educators can only contain one member. Remove any additional admins or members and try again.

## Contact support

Your educational institution may not be recognized by our system. Our team can help â€” email us at email protected.
