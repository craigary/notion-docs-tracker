Notion Mail makes it easy to share your availability as youâ€™re coordinating meetings in your emails. To use this feature, youâ€™ll need to connect to Notion Calendar first. You can go to Notion Calendar by clicking the calendar icon at the bottom of your Notion Mail sidebar.

Once Notion Calendar is connected, Notion Mail will be able to see your schedule and help you schedule future events based on your availability. To schedule a meeting using Notion Mail:

1. Open the composer and click the calendar icon at the bottom. Alternatively, you can use the command `/schedule`.

2. In the mini version of your Notion Calendar that appears, click and drag to indicate the time slots during which youâ€™re available to meet.

3. Click back into the composer to generate a scheduling link for your recipients.

**Note:** When you share availability using Notion Mail, it will take into account all events across all calendars connected to your Notion Calendar account!
