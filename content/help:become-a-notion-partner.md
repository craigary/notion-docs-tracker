## FAQs

### Can one person have multiple certifications that count toward partner-tier requirements?

No. Certifications must be held by unique individuals to count toward team minimums.


### Why was my application declined?

Applications may stall when case studies and outcomes are thin, offers aren‚Äôt defined, or a named delivery team with real bandwidth and SLAs hasn‚Äôt been established. Additionally, we prioritize alignment to our core use cases, keep coverage balanced across regions and industries, and sometimes pause intake or limit specific tracks (services vs. resell) in certain markets. Strong references, healthy adoption, and operational maturity move you forward; when these signals aren‚Äôt yet in place, your application may be declined and we invite you to reapply once they are.
