**Note:**

* When you move content from one place to another, your content will be duplicated into the destination workspace or account, and the original content will continue to live where it used to.

* In the process of duplicating pages from one place to another, some content or settings in the duplicated page may be broken. This could include links, relations, permissions, page history, and more. We recommend keeping your original content until you're absolutely sure the duplicated content is set up correctly.

## Duplicate content to another workspace

If you have multiple workspaces associated with your Notion account and you want to duplicate content from one workspace to another:

1. Select `+ New page` in the sidebar of the workspace associated with the content you want to duplicate â€” this page will contain all of the content you want to duplicate to make it easier for you to do so in bulk.

2. From your sidebar, drag all the pages you want to duplicate into that new page.

3. Open the new page, then select `â€¢â€¢â€¢` â†’ `Move to`.

4. Open the dropdown next to your current workspaceâ€™s name, then select the destination workspace.

5. Find a place in your destination workspace for your duplicated pages to live.

6. Select `I understand, duplicate`.

## FAQs

### I tried changing my email address but got an error message saying: "A user with this email already exists.
