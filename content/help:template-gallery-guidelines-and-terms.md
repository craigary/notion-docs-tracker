## Paid templates

Notion offers creators the ability to sell templates on the Marketplace (‚ÄúPaid Templates‚Äù). In order to publish and maintain a Paid Template on the Notion Marketplace, you must (a) submit such Paid Template to Notion for approval and listing as a Paid Template; (b) sign up and register for an account with the Payment Processor (defined below) under the terms communicated to you by the Payment Processor; (c) provide the Paid Template to End Users in accordance with your contractual commitments to the End User and applicable law; (d) submit a creator profile to Notion for approval; and (e) provide ongoing commercially reasonable support to End Users of the Paid Template. You acknowledge Notion‚Äôs right to charge transaction, payment, and/or listing fees (‚ÄúNotion Fees‚Äù) as may be communicated to you from time to time either directly or in Documentation. ‚ÄúPayment Processor‚Äù means the third party payment processor that processes fees related to a Paid Template.

You acknowledge and agree that Notion may, at its sole discretion, initiate a refund related to any Purchase Fee (defined below) paid by an End User in connection with an End User‚Äôs purchase of one of your templates in the event that Notion determines such a refund is appropriate or as described in the Documentation or otherwise. Without limiting any other rights afforded Notion with respect to such refund, the parties acknowledge and agree that any refund may be processed through the Payment Processor and taken out of your Payment Processor account and returned to the relevant End User. In addition to a refund of the Purchase Fee, you will be responsible for payment of the Payment Processor transaction fee for the refund. In the event of a dispute or chargeback related to an End User purchase of a Paid Template, you will bear the financial responsibility for any such fees imposed by the relevant card network or payment processor and authorize Notion to deduct or charge such fees to your account with the Payment Processor.¬†

If You submit a Paid Template, such Paid Template is approved by Notion, and you follow the required registration and listing steps contained herein and as otherwise communicated to you, then you may list the Paid Template on the Notion Marketplace and charge End Users to purchase the Paid Template. Fees collected from the sale of your Paid Template (‚ÄúPurchase Fees‚Äù) must be processed through the Payment Processor account you registered for in connection with listing the Paid Template. You acknowledge and agree that Notion may be the listed merchant of record on such Purchase Fee charges to purchasers of your Paid Template. Purchase Fees shall be processed from the End User to You through the Payment Processor with Notion receiving the Notion Fees. Notion may revise the Notion Fees at any time. Continued listing of the Paid Template on the Notion Marketplace after notice of Notion‚Äôs collection of such fees, shall be deemed consent to the imposition and collection of such fees.\
\
You appoint and authorize Notion as your non-exclusive disclosed commercial agent to conduct any action necessary regarding the sale of your Paid Template on the Notion Marketplace including promoting, selling, distributing and resolving payment disputes for Your Paid Template on the terms and conditions of these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use, and Notion accepts such appointment. You agree to pay Notion the applicable Notion Fees for such services.\
\
You will select the pricing for your Paid Template during the listing process based on the options available through the Notion Marketplace. Unless otherwise authorized by Notion, all Paid Templates may only be listed and payable in U.S. dollars. Paid Templates may not be offered through the Notion Marketplace as a mechanism to drive direct or off Notion Marketplace sales (through use of a discount code or otherwise). Should Notion suspect you are engaging in such activity it may suspend or terminate your use of the Notion Marketplace.\
\
*Payment.&#x20;*&#x53;ubject to your compliance with these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use, for each sale of your Paid Template, we will remit to you the amount we've received for your sale of your Paid Template, less our Notion Fees, and any applicable taxes ("Net Proceeds"), in accordance with Notion‚Äôs then standard payment schedule for Paid Templates. You agree to provide the Payment Processor with valid bank account information in your name, so we can remit amounts owed to you to that account via the method we choose. We are entitled to accrue and withhold payments, without interest, until the total amount due to you (net of any tax withholding, as further described below) is at least the minimum required payout amount.¬† You are solely responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, and any other fees you incur as a result of payments made to you.\
\
*Refund Mechanics*. As noted above, we may issue refunds for your Paid Templates to End Users at any time at our sole discretion without liability. If a refund is issued before you receive the Net Proceeds for the refunded sale, you acknowledge that you will have no right to receive such Net Proceeds. If a refund is issued after you‚Äôve received the Net Proceeds for the refunded sale, we may offset such Net Proceeds from any amounts owed to you or we may require you to pay us back such Net Proceeds. If Notion can‚Äôt successfully receive payment for any refunded fees owed by you, Notion may cancel your Notion Marketplace account and remove your templates from the Notion Marketplace. Notwithstanding this section, you agree that Notion shall not be responsible for and will not issue any refunds out of its funds (excluding the Notion Fees for the transaction) related to your Paid Template for any reason, including your failure to support the Paid Template. When these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use terminate, we may withhold all payments owed to you for at least 60 days from the date such payments are otherwise due to you in order to ensure we can offset any amounts refunded to End Users or any other amounts we are entitled to.\
\
*Taxes*. Each party is responsible for the payment of all taxes (including any interest and penalties) in connection with these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use that are imposed on that party by law. Each party will be responsible for its own income taxes, employment taxes, and real property taxes. You are liable for all applicable taxes imposed on sales of your Paid Templates to End Users, but we will collect sales tax for such transactions and remit such taxes. We reserve the right to deduct or withhold any applicable taxes payable by you from amounts we owe to you, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, will constitute full payment to you. If we were required to collect a tax and did not do so at the time of sale, we reserve the right to later charge you for the applicable tax.

You acknowledge that Notion has no obligation to provide support or technical assistance regarding Your Work to the End Users of Your Work and you will not represent to End Users that Notion will provide such support.
