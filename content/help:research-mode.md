**Note:** This feature is only available on the Business or Enterprise Plan.

Research Mode conducts analysis on more complex or open-ended queries. You could use it to try creating a report on a project or exploring a hypothesis you have.

To use Enterprise Search, open the `Home` tab in Notion, select `Research` at the bottom of the search window, and enter your query.

When you’re in Research Mode, Notion AI can:

* Search across your Notion workspace, connected apps, and the web. It includes Notion pages, databases, uploaded files (like PDFs), and content from connected apps such as Slack, Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, Jira, Zendesk, Asana, and GitHub – depending on your enabled Connectors and permissions. Use the `All sources` menu to choose specific sources for Research Mode to look at.

* Find pages in databases.

* Identify whether a page is part of a database and query it.

* Filter and sort a database based on its properties. For example, you can ask Notion AI to look at all projects in a database that are due before a certain date and have a status of `In progress`.

* Read database pages within a page.

Once you enter your query, Notion AI will show you the sources that it’s using to gather insights and generate a report. You can click `👍🏼` or `👎🏼` to help Notion AI improve, or ask follow up questions to continue your research. Once Notion AI is done researching your query, you can `Copy` the information it’s provided or `Save as page` to keep the report in your workspace.

hc: turn off web search

You can turn off web search in Research Mode by selecting `All sources` and toggling off `Web search`.

If you’d like to turn off all web search for Notion AI across your entire workspace, you can go to `Settings` → `Notion AI` and under `AI Web Search`, toggle off `Enable web search for workspace`.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x52;esearch Mode can take up to 10 minutes based on how complex your query is.
