* Notion AI can save you time by autofilling certain types of database properties! [Learn more here →](https://www.notion.com/help/creating-and-editing-with-ai#autofill)

* You can apply a layout to all pages in a database so that all of your database properties can be organized how you want. [Learn more here →](https://www.notion.com/help/layouts)

## Create a property

To create your first property in a database, click `Add property`. Give your property a name, then choose a property type.

To add a property to a database that already has existing properties:

* Select `+` next to the right-most property. Give your property a name, then choose a property type.

* In table view, click on an existing property → `Insert left` or `Insert right` depending on where you want your new property to live in your table. Give your property a name, then choose a property type.

## Edit properties

To manage and edit the properties of a database, open the settings menu at the top of the database and select `Edit properties`.

![hc: db settings icon](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/8Oc0IxM1zM5a9prvSOKNt/c07afa142404beaf680fb079ee9bc085/Reference_Visuals_Group_159.png)

From here, you can:

* Search for a property.

* Create a `New property`.

* Click into specific properties to edit them. You can adjust settings that are specific to a property (for example, you can wrap a text property), duplicate a property, or delete a property.

You can also edit individual properties by clicking directly into them in your database. This will open a menu where you can edit the property’s name, filter or sort by that property, run calculations, and more.

### Hide or show properties

If you want specific properties to be hidden or shown in a database view:

1. Open the settings menu at the top of the database.

2. Select `Property visibility`.

3. Select `👁️` next to a property to hide or show it.

## Edit property values

Any data put into a property is called a value. The way you edit values is different for each type of property. Here are just a few examples:

* For `Select` and `Multi-select` properties, you'll be prompted to add tags by typing what you want and pressing enter after each. Colors are randomly assigned.

  * You can add as many unique tags to these menus as you want.

  * Edit tag names and colors, or delete them by clicking on the property field (i.e. the table cell), then `•••` that appears to the right when you hover over any property.

  * Reorder tags by grabbing the `⋮⋮` icon to their left and dragging.

* For `Date` properties, clicking to add data will bring up our date picker, where you can select the day relevant to the database item — maybe it's an event date or deadline.

  * Click `Remind` to set a reminder in this property that will notify you on the given date and time.

  * Switch on `End date` to define a range of dates in this property.

  * Switch on `Include time` to choose an exact time, not just a day.

  * Click `Date format & timezone` to modify these settings.

  * Click `Clear` to remove any value in the date property.

* For `Files & media` properties, clicking on the field provided will prompt you to upload a file, or paste a link to embed a file.

  * You can also drag a file from your computer into the property to upload it.

  * You can add multiple files into any field at once.

  * Click on the `•••` to the right of uploaded files to `Delete`, `Download`, `Full screen` or `View original`.

  * Use the `⋮⋮` to the left of uploaded files to drag and re-order them.

* In a `Person` property, you can tag other members or guests in your workspace.

  * Just type their names and press `enter` after each.

  * To delete anyone tagged, click on them, then click `X` next to their name.

* Values automatically appear for these properties: `Created time`, `Created by`, `Last edited time`, `Last edited By`.

* You can simply type or paste values for `URL`, `Email`, `Phone` and `Number` properties, just like you would for a `Text` property.

* Editing values for `Relation` and `Rollup` properties requires multiple steps.

## Conditional color

**Note:&#x20;**&#x54;o apply conditional color to database pages, you must have `Can edit content` access, `Can edit` access, or `Full access` to that database. If you can only view or comment on a database, you can see color for database pages but can’t edit any color settings.

To help you visually distinguish your database items from one another, you can assign a color to database pages based on certain conditions. For example, maybe you want all overdue tasks in a task database to be shown in red.

To apply conditional color to a database view:

1. Select the slider icon at the top of your database view.

2. Under `View settings`, select `Conditional color`.

3. Select `New color setting`.

4. Select the database property you want to color by.

5. Open the dropdown next to your property name and set a rule for your color setting.

6. Select a `Page background` color.

   * If applicable, your database pages will match the color of the property values associated with them by default. For example, if your priority property has `P0` in red and `P1` in orange and you’re coloring your database by priority, all P0 pages will be displayed in red and all P1 pages will be displayed in orange. You can change this at any time!

     [](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/7fEfW2szncwyh71ZRKDNpA/8fda071947403ea9412db8e2d4594047/conditional_color.mp4)

7. If you're in table view, open the menu next to `Apply to` and choose whether you’d like to apply the color to the entire row or just the property that your rule applies to.

8. Select `Add another` to create additional color conditions for your database view.

### How conditional color can be applied

* Conditional color is available on the following views:

  * Table

  * Calendar

  * Timeline

  * List

  * Board

  * Feed

* Conditional color can be applied based on the following properties:

  * Select

  * Multi-select

  * Status

  * Title

  * Text

  * Number

  * Date

  * Person

  * Checkbox

  * Formulas

  * Relations

  * Rollups

* Conditional color settings are created at the view level. Different database views can have different conditional color settings, and conditional color settings applied to one database view won’t automatically apply to the database’s other views. However, when you duplicate a view, its color settings will also be duplicated.

* Conditional color applies at the page level; at this time, you can’t have specific properties colored in a page or card. Color applies to a page’s entire background.

* To apply conditional color to a property and not an entire database page, you must be in a **table view** of a database.

### Delete a color setting

To delete a color setting:

1. Select the slider icon at the top of your database view.

2. Under `View settings`, select `Conditional color`.

3. Select `🗑️` next to the setting you want to delete.

## Comment in properties

You can leave comments in database properties, **only when you’re in table view or when you have a database page open**.

**Note:**

* At this time, you can’t comment in name, formula, rollup, button, and unique ID properties.

* Properties must already have a value assigned before someone can comment on them.

To comment on a property while in table view:

1. Hover over a property for a database item.

2. Select the `💬` that appears.

3. Enter your comment.

**Note:** While you can comment on a checkbox property, you’ll have to open the database page to do so — there won’t be a way to do this from table view.

To comment on a property while in a database page:

1. Hover over a property.

2. Select the `💬` that appears, or select the `⋮⋮` to the left of the property → `Comment`.

3. Enter your comment.

Once a comment has been made, you’ll see `💬` next to the property it’s attached to. You can select `💬` to see the comment and add to the conversation.

## Assign permissions to people mentioned in person properties

You can assign specific access levels to people mentioned in a person or created by property in a database page. Learn more about this [here →](https://www.notion.com/help/sharing-and-permissions#database-page-level-access)
