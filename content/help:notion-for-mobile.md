## Notion AI shortcut on iOS

You can create a shortcut on your iOS device to quickly access [Notion AI](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs). There are several ways to get to Notion AI on your device:

1. Tell Siri to open Notion AI.

2. Search for Notion in [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3c511548/ios).

3. Open the `Shortcuts` app on your device. Look for `Notion` and tap `AI` to ask your question. If you want to save the Notion AI shortcut to your home screen, hold down on `AI`, then tap `Add to Home Screen`.

4. If you have the iPhone 15 Pro, customize the [action button](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphe89d61d66/ios) so that it opens Notion AI.

## Key differences between mobile and desktop

* There are no hover states on mobile. Instead, you'll seeÂ `â€¢â€¢â€¢`Â andÂ `+`Â icons. On desktop, these icons only appear on hover.

* There are no columns on mobile. Any column structure that you created on desktop will be collapsed to a single column.

On mobile, you also can't take the following actions. You'll have to log in on your desktop or in your browser to:

* Select multiple blocks on a page at a time.

* Import data.

* Change your account information (photo, email address, name, etc.)

* Delete or leave workspaces.

* Edit workspace security settings.

* Edit plan or billing settings.
