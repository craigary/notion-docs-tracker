## Link to a Notion page

### Inline in a paragraph

There are a few ways to link another Notion page inside a paragraph:

* @-mention: Type `@`, then start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.

* \[\[ command: Type `[[`, then start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.

* \+ command: Type `+`, then start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.

### As a block

You can insert a link into a Notion page as a block so you can easily place it wherever you want in the page. To do this:

1. In a page, enter the slash command `/link`. Alternatively, you can click the `+` that appears on hover to the left of any block, and select `Link to page` from the dropdown.

2. Start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.

3. To move the block, click `â‹®â‹®` to the left of it and drag it to your desired location in the page.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x57;hen you add a `Link to page` block, the linked page will show up in your sidebar under the page where you inserted the link, just like any other sub-page.

## Link to a block

Every block in Notion has its own anchor link that can be copied and shared. These are great for directing someone's attention to a specific part of a long Notion page! To link to a specific block:

1. Hover over the block and click the `â‹®â‹®` that appears to the left.

2. Select `Copy link to block`. This will copy the URL of that specific block to your clipboard.

3. Paste this URL anywhere â€” in a Notion page, a Slack message, an email, and more.

## Link to a web page

When you paste a web pageâ€™s URL into Notion, it can create a compact, easy-to-read link mention to help your page look nice and clean. You can even hover over the link to see a quick preview. To use a link mention in your page:

1. Paste the URL.

2. In the menu that appears, select `Paste as mention`.

3. The web page will be displayed with an icon, the source, and the title of the page.

**Note:**

* Link mentions work best with public web pages. Any links that require certain permissions or authentication to view wonâ€™t be pasted into Notion with any rich information.

* If your browser has cookies blocked, link mentions may not render properly.

When you link to something inside of an app that integrates with Notion, Notion can generate a preview for it! Learn which platforms are supported [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/link-previews-and-synced-databases#link-previews)

## Backlinks

Backlinks show you all the pages that link to the page youâ€™re currently on. You can use these to navigate your workspace.

Backlinks are created automatically every time you @-mention a page. To see a pageâ€™s backlinks, select `{#} backlinks` under its title, or its properties if itâ€™s a database page.

You will only be able to see backlinks for pages you have access to. Other people wonâ€™t see backlinks to your private pages. Backlinks to pages that are only visible to you will be labeled as `Private`.

## Customize backlinks

In any page, you can choose whether you want to show or hide backlinks.

1. Click theÂ `â€¢â€¢â€¢`Â button at the top right of the page and selectÂ `Customize page`.

2. Open the dropdown next to `Backlinks` and choose whether you want to `Always show` backlinks, `Show on hover` only, or turn them `Off`.

3. Toggle on or off `Page discussions`.

To customize backlinks and comments for a **database page**:

1. Click `â€¢â€¢â€¢` at the top right of the page and selectÂ `Customize layout`.

2. Click on the `Heading` module.

3. Open the dropdown next to `Backlinks` and choose whether you want to `Always show` backlinks, `Show on hover` only, or turn them `Off`.

4. Select `Apply to all pages` at the top of the page. Note that your backlink and comment customizations will apply to every page in the database you're in. Learn more about database layouts [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/layouts)

## FAQs

### How do I automatically open Notion links in the desktop app?

If you want any links to Notion pages to open in your desktop app:

1. Open Notion in your web browser.

2. Go to `Settings` â†’ `Preferences`.

3. Toggle on `Open links in desktop app`.

You'll need to have the desktop app already installed. Youâ€™ll also need to go to Notion in your desktop app and ensure that `Open Notion links in browser` is turned off in your settings.


### What's the difference between @-mentioning a page, and adding a Link to page block?

`Link to page` works kind of like creating a sub-page. When you reference a Notion page this way, it will show up in your sidebar as a subpage of the page where it was linked.

@-mentioning a page creates something more like a hyperlink. Pages you @-mention wonâ€™t show up as subpages of the pages theyâ€™ve been mentioned in.
