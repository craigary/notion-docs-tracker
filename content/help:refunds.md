Our refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or email email protected. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount if you **downgrade your subscription and contact us** within three days of the invoice being created after signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of the invoice creation after signing up for annual billing.

If you were invoiced for members accidentally added to your workspace, we're happy to provide a refund of the prorated charges if you reach out within three days of the invoice date. Please make sure the additional members have been removed from your workspace before writing in.

**Note:** If you've purchased a subscription through the Apple App Store and would like a refund, you'll need to contact the Apple App Store directly.
