**Note:** You'll see `cmd/ctrl` used a lot below. This indicates `command` on Mac and `control` on Windows and Linux. These instructions are for English/QWERTY keyboards, but internationalization is on the roadmap!

## Most popular

If you're not a born shortcutter, we get it. You can still work like a Notion power user if you remember these few commands:

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `F` to search inside a page.

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `P` or `cmd/ctrl` + `K` to open search or jump to a recently viewed page.

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `L` to copy a page’s URL.

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `[` to go to back a page.

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `]` to go forward a page.

* Use `ctrl` + `shift` + `K` on Mac or `ctrl` + `K` on Windows while in database peek view to go to the previous database page.

* Use `ctrl` + `shift` + `J` on Mac or `ctrl` + `J` on Windows while in database peek view to go to the next database page.

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `L` to toggle between dark mode and light mode.

### Desktop keyboard shortcuts

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `N` to create a new page.

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `N` to open a new Notion window.

* Use `option` + `shift` + `click` to open a page as a new window.

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `click` to open a link as a new Notion tab.

* Use `cmd/ctrl` + `T` to create a new Notion tab.

**Tip:** You can add any emoji in-line on a Notion page by typing `:` followed by the name of the emoji, like `:apple` for 🍎 or `:clapping` for 👏.

You can also bring up your computer's emoji picker with the shortcut `ctrl` + `cmd` + `space` on Mac and `windows key` + `.`or `windows key` + `;` on Windows.

## Markdown style

**While typing:**

* Type `**` on both sides of your text to **bold.**

* Type `*` on both sides of your text to *italicize*.

* Type \` on both sides of your text to create `inline code`. (That's the symbol to the left of your 1 key.)

* Type `~` on both sides of your text to strikethrough.

**At the beginning of any new line or existing block of content, try these:**

* Type `*`, `-`, or `+` followed by `space` to create a bulleted list.

* Type `[]` to create a to-do checkbox, followed by `space`. (There's no `space` in between.)

* Type `1.`, `a.`, or `i.` followed by `space` to create a numbered list.

* Type `#` followed by `space` to create an H1 heading.

* Type `##` followed by `space` to create an H2 sub-heading.

* Type `###` followed by `space` to create an H3 sub-heading.

* Type `>` followed by `space` to create a toggle list.

* Type `"` followed by `space` to create a quote block.

## Create & style your content

* Press `enter` to insert a line of text.

* Press `shift` + `enter` to create a line break within a block of text.

* Press `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `M` to create a comment.

* Type `---` to create a divider. (Three dashes in a row.)

* With text selected, press `cmd/ctrl` + `B` to **bold text**.

* With text selected, press `cmd/ctrl` + `I` to *italicize text*.

* With text selected, press `cmd/ctrl` + `U` to *underline text*.

* With text selected, press `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `S` for strikethrough.

* With text selected, press `cmd/ctrl` + `K` to add a link. You can also paste a URL over selected text to turn it into a link using `cmd/ctrl` + `V`.

* With text selected, press `cmd/ctrl` + `E` for inline code.

* Press `tab` to indent and nest content. Whenever you indent, you're nesting that block inside the block above it. If you select the parent, everything nested under it will also be selected.

* Press `shift` + `tab` to un-nest content.

* Type `/turn` at the beginning or end of a block to turn it into a different type of block. You'll see a list of choices pop up.

* Type `/color` at the beginning or end of any text block to change its color or highlight color. (To remove a color or highlight, just type `/default`.) Example: `/blue`, `/blue background`

For all of these content creation shortcuts, `cmd` + `option` is the combination for Mac, and `ctrl` + `shift` is the combination for Windows and Linux:

Note: Windows machines might have `ctrl` + `shift` bound already by another function - [learn more here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-disable-ctrlshift-shortcut-for-switching/4fa07ac4-afca-492e-9d06-62100042b4b6).

## Edit & move blocks

Everything in Notion is a block — from a line of type (or paragraph) to an image or embed. These shortcuts let you edit whole blocks once they're selected.

* Press `esc` to select the block you're currently in. Or to clear selected blocks.

* Press `cmd/ctrl` + `a` once to select the block your cursor is in.

* Press `space` to open a selected image in full-screen. Or to exit full-screen.

* Press `arrow keys` to select a different block.

* Hold down `shift` + `up/down arrow keys` to expand your selection up or down.

* Use `cmd` + `shift` + `click` on Mac, and `alt + shift + click` on Windows/Linux to select or de-select an entire block.

* Use `shift` + `click` to select another block and all blocks in between.

* Press `backspace` or `delete` to delete selected blocks.

* Press `cmd/ctrl` + `D` to duplicate the blocks you've selected.

* Press `enter` to edit any text inside a selected block (or open a page inside a page).

* Press `cmd/ctrl` + `/` to edit or change one or more selected blocks.

  * Use this shortcut to change the type of block, the color, or to edit, duplicate, or move the block. You'll see a text box at the top of the menu that pops up. Just type the action, block or color you want.

* In a database, select multiple rows or cards, then use `cmd/ctrl` + `/` to edit them all at once.

* Hold `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `arrow keys` to move a selected block around.

* Press `cmd/ctrl` + `option/alt` + `T` to expand or close all toggles in a toggle list.

* Press `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `H` to apply the last text or highlight color you used.

* Press `cmd/ctrl` + `enter` to modify the current block you're in. Modify means:

  * Open a page

  * Check or uncheck a to-do checkbox

  * Open or close a toggle list item

  * Make embeds or images full-screen

## @ commands

* **Mention a person:** Type `@` and another workspace member's name to get their attention on something. They'll be notified. Useful in comments and discussions.

* **Mention a page:** Type `@` and the name of another page in your workspace to create a link to it inline. If you change the name of the page, this link will automatically change too.

* **Mention a date:** Type `@` and a date in any format (or "yesterday," "today" or "tomorrow," or even "next Wednesday"). Helpful for giving yourself due dates.

* **Add a reminder:** Type `@remind` followed by a date in any format (including "yesterday," "today," "tomorrow," etc.). You can click on the link that appears to adjust the date and exact time you want to be reminded. You'll receive a notification at that time.

* Hit `esc` to dismiss the @-command menu if you simply want to type @.

## \[\[ commands

* **Link a page:** Type `[[` and the name of another page in your workspace to create a link to it. If you change the name of the page, this link will automatically change too.

* **Create a sub-page:** Type `[[` and the name of the sub-page you want to nest within your current page. Use your cursor or arrow keys to select `+ Add new sub-page` in the dropdown that appears.

* **Create a new page somewhere else:** Type `[[` and the name of the page you want to create. Use your cursor or arrow keys to select `↗ Add new page in...` in the dropdown that appears, then select the page or database where you'd like that page to be added.

## + commands

* **Create a sub-page:** Type `+` and the name of the sub-page you want to nest within your current page. Use your cursor or arrow keys to select `+ Add new sub-page` in the dropdown that appears.

* **Create a new page somewhere else:** Type `+` and the name of the page you want to create. Use your cursor or arrow keys to select `↗ Add new page in...` in the dropdown that appears, then select the page or database where you'd like that page to be added.

* **Link a page:** Type `+` and the name of another page in your workspace to create a link to it. If you change the name of the page, this link will automatically change too.

**Tip**: When you use `[[`, the dropdown menu will show **page linking** options first. When you use `+`, the dropdown menu will show **page creation** options first.
