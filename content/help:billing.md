## Youâ€™re billed upfront

You always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval.

If you **upgrade your plan** in the middle of your billing interval, the new plan will take effect immediately and start a new billing period. Youâ€™ll be charged immediately for the new plan. The amount due will be reduced by a prorated amount based on the time remaining in your previous billing period for your current plan.

If you **add members** midâ€‘cycle, weâ€™ll charge for the portion of the interval theyâ€™re in the workspace. Proration applies only when you add members during a billing interval; if you **remove members**, billing decreases take effect at your next billing cycle and are not prorated midâ€‘cycle.

## Youâ€™re billed per member, per workspace

Notion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in a workspace. One seat is assigned to each member in a workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.

**If you have multiple paid Notion workspaces, youâ€™ll be billed for them separately based on how many members you have in each. This applies even if youâ€™re using the same Notion account for those workspaces, and even if the same people are in multiple workspaces. You can also have different billing intervals per workspace.**

Go to `Settings` in your sidebar â†’ `People` to view how many paid seats a workspace has, how many members are currently in your workspace, and when you'll be billed next. You can easily manage workspace members here.

### Accidental member additions

Before you add someone to your workspace as a member, remember that **adding members to a paid Notion workspace is a billable action and will incur additional charges on your invoice**.

If you donâ€™t want to add a new member to your workspace but would like to collaborate with people via Notion, you can invite **guests** to specific Notion **pages** instead, provided you havenâ€™t met [your planâ€™s guest limit](https://www.notion.com/pricing). Guests get access at the page level and are more limited in what they can do in a Notion workspace. Learn more about members and guests [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/whos-who-in-a-workspace)

To avoid accidentally adding members to your workspace, go to the Notion page you want to invite a guest to, select `Share` at the top of that page, and after you enter their email address, hover over their email address to confirm that theyâ€™re being added as a guest before you select `Invite`.

Youâ€™ll be asked if youâ€™d like to upgrade the guest to a member â€” select `Skip for now` to ensure that theyâ€™ll be added to that page at no cost.

### Adding and removing members

Hereâ€™s what happens when you add or remove members.

| **When you add members to your workspace**                                                                                                                                              | **When you remove members from your workspace**                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, we review how many members you've added and issue invoices on a monthly basis.                                                   | You have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your current billing interval. You can reassign an open seat to a different member at no additional charge until the interval ends. |
| Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, changes made in the middle of a billing interval are reflected retroactively in your next invoice.                          | At the end of your current billing interval, we recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.                                                   |
| We prorate charges for added members for the remainder of the current billing interval. You only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that a member belonged to your workspace. | No proration for removals. Any decrease in member count is reflected at your next billing cycle.                                                                                                |

Letâ€™s look at a quick example of what happens when you remove members from your workspace.

* Say your team is working with three contractors who have been added as members to your Notion workspace.

* When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.

* Until the end of your current billing period (monthly or annual), you can fill these three paid seats in Notion with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member â€” at no additional cost.

* Once your current billing period is over, weâ€™ll review how many paid seats are actually being used in your workspace and adjust your following invoice accordingly.

For more examples and information regarding member addition and removal, see [this article â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/members-and-billing)

## Yearly vs. monthly billing

You can choose to pay for Notion on a yearly or monthly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay.

* Yearly billing costs less.

* Your plan renews automatically either once a year or once a month.

  * If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.

  * If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.

  * For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.

* **Your bill adjusts for your paid seat count either once a year or once a month.**

  * Monthly: If you add members midâ€‘month, youâ€™ll be charged for the days from the add date through your next renewal date. If you remove members, your bill will decrease starting on your next monthly renewal date.

  * Annual: If you add members midâ€‘year, youâ€™ll receive a prorated invoice for the remainder of the annual term through your next annual renewal date. If you remove members, your bill will decrease at your next annual renewal date.

  * When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.

If you expect your team size to fluctuate often, or youâ€™d like more control over your budget, we recommend a monthly billing interval.

## Change your billing interval

To change your billing interval:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Click `Billing` in the sidebar of the window that pops up.

3. Next to your current billing interval, select `Edit period`.

4. Youâ€™ll see your new billing details and an estimate for your next bill. Click `Confirm changes` if everything looks good.

### Change from monthly to yearly

**When you change from monthly to yearly**, you'll establish a new billing cycle, with your plan automatically renewing on the calendar day you made this change the next year.

Whatever amount of time is left on your already paid monthly cycle will be subtracted from your annual payment.

For example:

* Let's say youâ€™re on the Plus Plan, billed monthly.

* By April 15, you love Notion so much that you switch to a yearly billing interval.

* You already paid for part of the month, so we prorate the price of your yearly plan.

* Since half the month went by, we remove the unused time (the latter half of the month) from your yearly price.

### Change from yearly to monthly

**When you change from yearly to monthly**, the new monthly billing cycle will take effect the day your annual cycle ends. Your plan will automatically renew each month on the same calendar day going forward.

## See your plan and billing details

**Note:** Only workspace owners can view and manage plans and billing.

2. Click `Billing` in the sidebar of the pop-up window.

3. At the top, you'll see which plan you're on, how much you're paying for it either yearly or monthly, and the date it will renew.

### What payment methods do you accept?

For a list of payment methods you can use, see [this article â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/payment-methods)


### My paid workspace just got downgraded to a free plan. What happened?

You may have an unpaid invoice on your account â€” our system will automatically downgrade a paid account after several attempts are made to collect payment.

That said, you can re-upgrade via the `Upgrade` tab in `Settings` and settle your unpaid invoices from there. Send us a message if you need help!


### I just upgraded to a paid plan, but one of my workspaces still says it's on a free plan.

Plans only apply to a single workspace and don't cover your whole account. We recommend using the fewest workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized. [More on that here](https://www.notion.com/help/navigate-with-the-sidebar).


### How can I avoid needing multiple workspaces?

We've seen people create multiple workspace instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, their executive team, etc. so they can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. You don't need to do this. Instead:

* Disable `Workspace Access`. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.

* On every page, [grant different levels of access per group](https://www.notion.com/help/add-members-admins-guests-and-groups#groups). Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.

* So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn on `Full Access` for only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!
