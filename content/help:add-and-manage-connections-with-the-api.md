**Note:&#x20;**&#x4F;n Enterprise Plans, the following can be restricted to workspace owners:

* The ability to [add connections](https://www.notion.com/help/add-and-manage-connections-with-the-api#add-connections-in-your-workspace) and decide who can connect or disconnect integrations at the page level.

* The ability to [install workspace-wide security and compliance integrations](https://www.notion.com/help/add-security-and-compliance-integrations).

## Add connections in your workspace

Members can add connections to a workspace in `Settings` → `Connections`. Workspace owners can add connections to a workspace in `Settings` → `Connections`. Once a connection is added, it can be added to more pages.

## Add connections to pages

Connections built with the API follow a similar permission system to the sharing permissions for Notion users. In order to use a connection in your workspace, you'll need to add it to the specific page where it will be active.

* Navigate to a page and select `•••` at the top right.

* At the bottom of the pop-up, click `Add connections`.

* In the resulting pop-up, search for and select the connection you would like to add to this page. You'll only see connections that have been created for and associated with this workspace.

* The connection will now appear in the `•••` menu for the page.

* If you want to remove a connection from a page, hover over its name and then press `Disconnect`.

### Manage connections in pages

**Note:** This feature is only available to users on the Enterprise Plan. Domain verification is not required to enable this feature.

Workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can decide what pages an integration can access, as well as who can connect integrations to or disconnect integrations from pages. To do this:

1. Go to `Settings` → `Connections`.

2. In the `Member` tab, select `•••` next to a connection.

3. In the menu that appears, select `Manage page access`.

4. Under `Select pages`, find and select specific pages that you want to give permission to the integration to access.

5. Under `Who can manage page access`, open the dropdown menu. Select `Default` if you want all workspace owners and members to be able to manage access. Select `Workspace owners` if you want only workspace owners to be able to manage access.

If you choose to allow only `Workspace owners` to manage access, that means only workspace owners will be able to go into the `•••` menu at the top of a page → `Connections` to connect or disconnect internal and public integrations from that page. Members won’t be able to take this action.

## Manage connections in your workspace

**Note:** Workspace owners manage all connections in a workspace. <!-- -->Learn more [here →](https://www.notion.com/help/enterprise-connection-settings)

* In your left sidebar, navigate to `Settings` and then the `Connections` tab.

* Here, you'll see two tabs, `Members` and `Workspaces`.

  * From the `Members` tab, you can manage the integrations that members can access in the workspace. Specifically, you can limit integration access to an approved list of integrations, view who is using an internal integration and disconnect the use of any integration in the workspace.

    * Note: Only Enterprise Workspace Owners can limit integration access to an approved list of integrations.

  * From the `Workspaces` tab, you can install and manage Security & Compliance integrations for their entire Enterprise workspace.

* Click the `•••` next to an connection to see additional options:

  * Retrieve an internal API token

  * Visit the developer's website or contact their support

  * View users with access to the connection

  * Disconnect the connection

## Install from a developer

### [Check out our integration gallery →](https://www.notion.com/integrations/all)

### Install directly from a partner platform via OAuth

Notion has partnered directly with several services (such as [Zapier](https://www.notion.com/integrations/zapier) and [Typeform](https://www.notion.com/integrations/typeform)). You can add our partners' public connections to your workspace directly through their sites via OAuth.

* Search for `Notion` in the partner platform's app menu and add it.

* In the resulting authentication menu, you'll be asked by the partner connection to allow access your workspace. The access levels required by the connection will be specified.

* Connections are workspace-specific! Click the workspace name at the top right to switch to another workspace if needed. Then, press `Select pages`.

* Now, you'll see a list of all of the pages in the selected workspace. Choose the pages you would like the connection to be able to access, and then press `Allow access`.

* Once you've completed the authentication, you'll see this connection in your workspace's `Settings` menu → `Connections`.

* Click the `•••` menu next to the connection name to visit the developer's website, contact the developer's support team, or disconnect the connection from your workspace.

### Install via internal integration token

Some partner platforms require an internal integration token in order to link to your workspace.

* In this case, first follow these instructions to create a corresponding internal integration for your workspace.

* Once you've created the internal integration, navigate to `Settings` in your sidebar and then the `Connections` tab.

* Click the `•••` menu next to the existing connection that you'd like to link to a partner platform, and press `Copy internal integration token`.

* Paste this internal integration token into the corresponding field on the partner platform's set up form.

**Note:** Notion does not support troubleshooting for partner integrations. Please direct any feedback and questions to the respective partner's support team.
