To compose an email, click üìù at the top of your Notion Mail sidebar.

Add a recipient and a subject, then click into the body of your email to start writing.

## Slash menu and commands

Type `/` into your message‚Äôs body to pull up a menu of blocks that you can use to create your email. Blocks, like the ones in Notion, are content types ranging from plain text to headings to images that can help you spruce up your emails.

Select a block from the menu or type a slash command like `/image` to utilize a specific block type.

## Snippets

Snippets are short templates of text that you can use over and over to save time on writing emails. If there‚Äôs something you say frequently in your email conversations, it could be something you turn into a snippet. This could be your phone number, an invitation to connect, or a link to your website.

To create and insert a snippet from your composer:

1. Open your composer and click `{}` at the bottom.

2. Select `New snippet`.

3. Set a shortcut for your snippet. This would be the slash command you enter into your composer to pull up your snippet, like `/website link`.

4. Enter the content of your snippet. Your snippet can be an entire email with a subject and recipients.

5. When you‚Äôre done, select `Save`.

To turn an email draft into a snippet:

1. Open your composer and click `{}` at the bottom.

2. Select `Turn into snippet`.

3. Your snippet will be given a shortcut name, which you can change. You can also edit the content of the snippet, its subject, and its recipient.

4. When you‚Äôre done, select `Save`.

To use an existing snippet in an email draft, pull up the `/` menu in the composer and look for your snippet or use the shortcut that you created for the snippet. You can also select `{}` at the bottom of the composer to insert an existing snippet.

## Quick replies

Quick replies are suggested responses that are generated for you based on the context of your email thread. When you have an email open, you‚Äôll see a quick reply at the bottom that you can click on to jumpstart your response.

**Note:** Quick replies will only be generated for conversations you‚Äôre having with other people. They won‚Äôt be generated in response to newsletters, invoices, and other similar emails.

## Attachments

To attach a file to your email, click `üìé` at the bottom of your composer and select a file from your device.

## Schedule send

To schedule an email to be sent at a specific date and time, select `v` next to `Send` at the bottom of your composer and choose the date and time you‚Äôd like the email to be sent. You can also adjust the time zone.

## Delete a draft

To discard a draft, click `üóëÔ∏è` at the bottom of your composer.

## Email delivery failure

If your messages aren‚Äôt sending, it may be due to the following:

* A Gmail network timeout.

* A Gmail rate limit error.

* A Gmail internal error or server issue.

* A Gmail token that‚Äôs been revoked, which means Notion Mail doesn‚Äôt have authorization to send your message.
