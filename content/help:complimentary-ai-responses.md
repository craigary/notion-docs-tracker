Everyone can try Notion AI for free. <!-- -->Once you've used all your complimentary AI responses, you will see a message that an upgrade to the Business or Enterprise Plan is necessary to continue using AI features. Youâ€™ll need to be a workspace owner, and on desktop, to [upgrade your plan](https://www.notion.com/help/upgrade-or-downgrade-your-plan#upgrade-your-plan).

### What counts as an AI response?

Every time you take an AI action (including creating new content, editing existing content, using AI blocks, adding an autofill property, asking a question, etc.) in Notion or [Notion Mail](https://www.notion.com/help/use-notion-ai-with-notion-mail) and receive a response from Notion AI, that counts as an AI response. Anytime you click `Try again`, that counts as an additional AI response.

The only exception is [creating a database with Notion AI](https://www.notion.com/help/autofill#create-a-database-with-notion-ai) â€” this action doesnâ€™t count toward your complimentary responses.
