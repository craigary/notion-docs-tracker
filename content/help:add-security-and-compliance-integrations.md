Only Enterprise workspace owners can install workspace-wide security and compliance integrations. To add a security and compliance integration:

1. Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Connections`.

2. Open the `Workspace` tab.

## Prerequisites for adding security and compliance integrations

* Your workspace must be on an Enterprise Plan.

* Only a workspace owner can configure security and compliance integrations for a Notion workspace.

* You must have admin privileges in the partner tool.

## DLP partner integrations

Integrating with a DLP solution will help detect the use of sensitive data in your workspace and take automated action to remediate data breaches quickly by alerting workspace owners, redacting content, or restricting page access.

### Supported DLP partners

**Nightfall AI**

1. In Notion, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Connections` ‚Üí open the `Workspace` tab.

2. Select `Connect` on the `Nightfall` tile ‚Üí `Connect to Nightfall`.

3. Authenticate with your Nightfall credentials.

4. You can find additional instructions [here](https://help.nightfall.ai/nightfall-ai/nightfall-for-notion), and learn more about the integration [here](https://www.nightfall.ai/integrations/notion).

### Disconnecting by partner

**Nightfall AI**

1. In Notion, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Connections` ‚Üí open the `Workspace` tab.

2. Select `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` beside the `Nightfall` integration ‚Üí `Disconnect`.

3. In the [Nightfall application](http://app.nightfall.ai), select `Notion` in `My Integrations`, and remove the relevant Notion workspace from the `Workspaces` list.

## SIEM partner integrations

Integrating with a SIEM solution will bring your Notion audit log information into a shared platform with the rest of your SaaS app logs in order to:

* Provide visibility into Notion user and workspace activity in a third-party audit log for better analysis, searches, and correlations.

* Configure off-the-shelf alerts on unusual user activity in real-time.

* Provide reports and dashboards to support incident investigation.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x4F;n the Notion end, we don‚Äôt support connecting to any SIEM partner until the partner instance is ready to handle events.

### Supported SIEM partners

**Datadog**

1. In Notion, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Connections` ‚Üí open the `Workspace` tab.

2. Select `Connect` on the `Datadog` tile ‚Üí `Connect to Datadog`.

   * **Note:** At this time, one Datadog instance can only be connected to one workspace at most.

3. Authenticate with your Datadog credentials by selecting your organization.

4. You can find additional instructions [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/?q=notion).

**Panther**

* Log into your Panther console.

* In the left side navigation of your Panther Console, select `Configure` ‚Üí `Log Sources` ‚Üí `Create New`.

* Search for `Notion`, then select the Notion tile.

* In the slide-out panel, the `Transport Mechanism` dropdown in the upper right corner will be pre-populated with the HTTP option. Select `Setup`.

* Follow [Panther's instructions for configuring an HTTP Source](https://docs.panther.com).

  * Note: You will be required to use [HMAC authentication](https://dev.notion.so/~/changes/Dd8nx2iqd1Pp2OzWJaWk/data-onboarding/data-transports/http#hmac).

* The `Header Name` associated with your `Secret Key Value` will be locked with a value of `x-notion-signature`.

* Be sure to securely copy your `Secret Key Value` and store it in a safe location. You'll need this to configure the connection in Notion.

* You can find additional instructions [here](https://docs.panther.com/~/changes/Dd8nx2iqd1Pp2OzWJaWk/data-onboarding/supported-logs/notion).

**Splunk**

* **Note:** Depending on your Splunk instance type, the `Webhook URL` and `Secret code` may vary.¬†Currently, we support Splunk Cloud or Enterprise licenses (not On-Prem).

* Retrieve `Webhook URL` (HEC URL).

* Log into your Splunk instance.

* Navigate to the `Search & Reporting` app and select `Settings`.

* Under the `Data` section, click on `HTTP Event Collector`.

* Locate the desired HEC configuration and select its name, or create a new one.

* On the configuration page, you'll find the HEC URL. Typically, it begins with https\:// followed by the hostname or endpoint provided by Splunk, and ends with the HEC token. For example: `https://<your-splunk-instance>.splunkcloud.com:8088/services/collector/event`

* Retrieve the `Secret code` (HEC token) and repeat the steps above.

* On the configuration page, you'll find the HEC token, a long alphanumeric string under the `Token` field.

* You can find additional instructions [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.4/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Create_an_Event_Collector_token_on_Splunk_Cloud_Platform).

**Sumo Logic**

* Log into your Sumo Logic instance.

* Select `Manage Data` ‚Üí `Collection`.

* Navigate to `Setup Wizard` and select `Get started`.

* When presented with `Data Type`, select `Your Custom App` ‚Üí `HTTPS Source`.

* Copy the `HTTP Source URL` into Notion settings.

* You can find additional instructions [here](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics/upload-logs/).

### Setup tips by partner

To set up most of this integration, you will need to manually provide a webhook URL or token.

* [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/notion): The `Webhook URL` and `Token` are not required.

* [Panther](https://docs.panther.com/~/changes/Dd8nx2iqd1Pp2OzWJaWk/data-onboarding/supported-logs/notion): Enter the HTTP Source URL in the `Webhook URL` field and the HMAC Authentication Secret Key Value in the `Token` field.

* Splunk: Enter the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) URL in the `Webhook URL` field and the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) token in the `Token` field.

* Sumo Logic: Enter the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) URL in the `Webhook URL` field. A token is required.

## Available SIEM events

Below is a comprehensive list of webhook events that will be available in your SIEM platform once you set up the Notion SIEM connection. All events available in your SIEM platform will correspond to an audit log event. The glossary will help you understand the specific events that are being tracked and how they relate to your organization's security posture. Use this information to fine-tune your dashboards, alerts, and incident management processes.

### Event types

Events are split into five main categories:

* **Page events**: This includes events users take on a single Notion page.

* **Teamspace events**:¬†This includes events users take on one or more teamspaces.

* **Workspace events**:¬†This includes events users take on an entire Notion workspace.

* **User events**:¬†This includes events about accounts of users in the workspace.

* **Integration events**:**&#x20;**&#x54;his includes events about internal integrations associated with the workspace.

### Page audience

For page events, the page audience describes the visibility level of the target page. The audience captured will be one of the following:

* **Private**: The page is not shared with other users.

* **Internal**:¬†The page is shared with other members of the workspace only.

* **External**:¬†The page is shared with one or more guests outside of the workspace and/or with an integration bot.

* **Public**:¬†The page is shared to the web.

## Compliance partner integrations

### Drata

If your policy content lives in Notion, you can connect Notion with Drata to manage that content. Changes you make to policies in Notion will be synced with Drata.

**Note:**

* For the best experience, try to avoid using database blocks in Notion pages that you sync with Drata.

* You can‚Äôt sync any private Notion pages to Drata.

* If a policy stored in Notion is deleted by a user, you‚Äôll be prompted to import a new file in Drata.

To integrate Notion with Drata:

1. In Notion, go to `Settings`‚Üí `Connections` ‚Üí open the `Workspace` tab.

2. Select `Connect` on the `Drata` tile.

3. Give Drata permission to access your Notion workspace, then select `Allow access`.

## FAQs

### I just made updates to a page, but I didn't receive a Slack notification.

There's a five minute delay built in to prevent these notifications from getting too noisy! email protected if you still aren't seeing them show up! We'll help out.


### I'm trying to enable the integration in Slack's App Directory, but it just takes me to Notion's homepage.

Sorry for the confusion üôàYou can't enable the integration from Slack. You'll need to turn it on inside Notion with the instructions on this page.


### What permissions are granted when the Slack integration is enabled? 

Notion's integration with Slack operates on a per-page basis. When you enable the Slack integration for a specific page in your Notion workspace, you're granting Notion access to publish updates to the Slack channel of your choosing.


### Can I add more than one login for a link preview integration?

You can! You can do so via `Settings` ‚Üí¬†`My connections`. For the desired integration, select ‚ÄúConnect another account‚Äù.

**Note**: Some applications do not support multi-account login in the browser (e.g. GitHub), so you might need to logout of whichever account is currently logged in on your browser to be prompted to login with a different account.

We‚Äôll determine which of your accounts to use to preview given resources and show an error if none of them are successful.


### I‚Äôm receiving a general  ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt load preview‚Äù error in my link preview.

Run through these steps to try to resolve.

1. Confirm you‚Äôve authenticated with the correct account for the resource.

2. Confirm no access restrictions for your organization.

3. Delete your integration in Notion via the¬†`My connection`¬†settings. You may also want to revoke the integration the corresponding platform: [GitHub, ](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-authorized-applications-oauth)[Jira, ](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/allowing-oauth-access-939938965.html#AllowingOAuthaccess-revokingtokensRevokingOAuthaccesstokens)[Slack, ](https://slack.com/help/articles/360003125231-Remove-apps-and-custom-integrations-from-your-workspace)[Asana, ](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/settings#gl-apps)[Trello.](https://help.trello.com/article/1183-revoking-a-trello-token)

4. Try to unfurl again.

5. Finally, if all else fails, reach out to support! Unfortunately, we cannot help resolve errors related to¬†**Access denied**¬†or¬†**Content not found.**¬†Please provide the following information when reaching out to support:

   * Integration you‚Äôre trying to use

   * Error message and code

   * URL you‚Äôre trying to preview (if possible)


### I‚Äôm receiving an ‚ÄúAccess denied‚Äù or ‚ÄúContent not found‚Äù error in my link preview.

There are two possible reasons for this:

1. You may not have authenticated with the account that has access. You can connect multiple accounts either through `Settings` ‚Üí `My connections`, or the error drop down.

2. Your organization may have limited access to content via 3rd party integrations or IP addresses. Please confirm with your workspace or organization administrator and ask to have Notion‚Äôs integration approved if this is the case. Here are instructions for specific integrations: [GitHub, ](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure)[Jira, ](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/manage-your-users-third-party-apps/)[Slack, ](https://slack.com/help/articles/222386767-Manage-app-approval-for-your-workspace)[Asana, ](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/admin-console#gl-apps)[Trello.](https://help.trello.com/article/1078-enterprise-admin-dashboard)


### What do security and compliance connections have access to in my workspace?

* SIEM integrations will be authorized to receive event logs on all workspace activity.

* DLP integrations will be authorized to:

  * Receive event logs on all workspace activity.

  * Vew content, view comments, edit content, edit comments, and create comments in **all&#x20;**&#x70;ages.

  * See basic information about all workspace members and guests, including their names, profile images, and email addresses.


### I‚Äôm not seeing SIEM events even after connecting. What should I do?

* Sometimes, the event may appear under a different label or in a different place than where you expect. We recommend triggering a new page event and querying in your SIEM querying language for `type: "page.created"` or `email: "[your email address]"` for all events triggered by you.

* When a new Panther <!-- -->instance is created, it can take up to 10 minutes for it to be fully ready to receive events.


### What happens to my SIEM events if my SIEM provider has an outage?

In the event of an outage, you should reach out to your SIEM provider for more information.


### Why can‚Äôt I connect more than one instance of the same SIEM provider?

SIEM provider can only be connected to a single Notion workspace at this time.


### Having trouble setting up your SIEM connections? Here are some common issues.

* Incorrect webhook URL

* Incorrect HMAC or HEC token

* Do not have admin privileges in your SIEM provider

* SIEM provider is an on-prem instance
