## Policy enforced error

If you're getting a Policy Enforced error when trying to access Notion Mail, it's possible that your organization doesn't authorize apps with the permissions requested by Notion Mail. Check with your organizationâ€™s administrator to see if this is the case.

## Notion Mail turned off for your workspace

Itâ€™s possible that Notion Mail has been turned off for your workspace by an organization owner. You can reach out to the owner of your organization to turn Notion Mail on for your organization. Once this is done, it may take around 24 hours for you to be able to sign up.

## Private relay emails

If you're using a private relay email, you won't be able to access Notion Mail. You'll need to change your email in Notion and make sure that it matches the email that you used to sign up for Notion Mail. If the emails don't match, add another account by opening the dropdown next to your name in Notion Mail and selecting `Add another account`.
