## Share with one person

You can invite people inside or outside your workspace to share a Notion page with you.

1. Start with your page inÂ `Private` in your sidebar.

2. On the page, go toÂ `Share`Â at the top right.

3. Enter the person's name or email address in the space provided, choose a level of access, and clickÂ `Invite`.

* If the person is outside your workspace, they'll join the page as a guest.

* If the person is already a member of your workspace, you'll see their profile photo pop up in the invite menu, and the page will show up underÂ `Shared`Â in your sidebar, as seen above.

## Share with your team

If you have multiple people working with you in Notion, you can quickly share any page with all of them. There are several ways to do this:

* **Share with everyone in your workspace.**Â ClickÂ `Share`Â at the top right of the page, and grant access to `Everyone at [workspace name]`. You can also assign everyone in your workspace a particular access level from the dropdown. For example, everyoneÂ `Can view`Â instead of being able to edit.

* **Create a page in any default teamspace in your sidebar.&#x20;**&#x45;veryone in your workspace is a member of default teamspaces and will automatically have access to pages in them. [Learn more about teamspaces â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/intro-to-teamspaces)

* **Drag a private page to a default teamspace in your sidebar.**Â This automatically shares it with everyone.

* **Share a page's URL.&#x20;**&#x45;very page in Notion has its own unique URL you can use to share it on Slack or elsewhere. Go toÂ `Share`Â at the top right and clickÂ `Copy link`. Only people who have access to the page can see it.

## Share with the web

If you want to share your page and collaborate on it with others, even people who arenâ€™t Notion users, select `Share` at the top of the page, open the dropdown under `General access`, and select `Anyone on the web with link`. Open the dropdown next to `Anyone on the web with link` and allow edit, comment, or view-only access. you can also set this link to expire at a specific time or date. `Copy link` and share it with anyone! Note that page visitors will need to be logged into Notion if they want to comment on or edit your page.

You can easily turn your Notion page into a beautiful website with Notion Sites. Learn more about how to share your page with the web [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing)
