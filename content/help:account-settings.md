If you're on web and you want any links to Notion pages to open in your desktop app:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar → `Preferences`.

2. Toggle on `Open links in desktop app`.

You'll need to have the desktop app already installed. You’ll also need to go to Notion in your desktop app and ensure that Open links in browser is turned off in your settings.

### If Notion links aren't automatically opening in the desktop app

If links to Notion pages aren't automatically opening in the desktop app, try following these steps:

1. Open the link in your browser.

2. Click `•••` at the top right of the page. Scroll to the bottom of the menu that appears and click `Open in Mac app`.

**Note:** On mobile, your Notion app language will follow the language ranking in your system preferences.

## Start your calendar week on Monday

Calendars in Notion will use Sunday or Monday as the first day of the week, depending on your region. That includes the date picker for reminders and calendar databases. If you prefer, you can change this manually. To do this:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar → `Preferences`.

2. Under `Language & Time`, toggle on or off `Start week on Monday`.

## Change your time zone

To change your time zone:

## Desktop app settings

If you’re using Notion’s desktop app, you can manage settings for the app by going to `Settings` in your sidebar → `Preferences`.

* Open the dropdown next to `On startup` to choose `Continue where you left off`, which will open the tabs you had open right before you last closed the app. Alternatively, you can choose `Your default page` if you’d like to start with the same page every time.

* If you want to use [Command Search](https://www.notion.com/help/search#use-command-search), which allows you to quickly search in Notion while you’re in another app, turn on `Use Command Search`. Once this setting is turned on, you can also turn on `Show Notion in menu bar` so you can get to Notion from the top of your screen, as well as adjust the `Keyboard shortcut for Command Search shortcut` and `Notion AI shortcut`.

* If you want search to open whenever you create a new tab, toggle on `New Tab Search`. This allows you to immediately search for and navigate to a specific page when you open a new tab. If this setting is toggled off, new tabs will display the default page specified in the `Default page` setting.

* If you want any links to Notion pages to open in your web browser instead of the desktop app, toggle on `Open Notion links in browser`. You’ll need to go to Notion in your browser and ensure that `Open links in desktop app` is turned off in your settings.

* If you set up links to open in the desktop app, your browser will open a new tab automatically redirect you to the desktop app every time you click on a link to a Notion page. To have these tabs automatically closed once you’re redirected to the desktop app, toggle on `Close redirecting browser tabs`.

## View history

If you don’t want your account to be recorded in page analytics, you can opt out altogether or for specific pages.

To opt out of participating in analytics altogether:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar → `Preferences`.

2. Under `Privacy`, open the dropdown next to `Show my view history` and select `Don't record`.

## Profile discoverability

You can decide if users with your email address can see your name and profile picture when they invite you to a new workspace. To do so:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar → `Preferences`.

2. Under `Privacy`, find `Profile discoverability`. Turn this on to make your profile discoverable to people with your email address, or turn it off to hide your profile from people with your email address.

If you turn profile discoverability on, a user will see this when they invite you to a workspace or a page:
