Notionâ€™s Marketplace is the trusted place to find all kinds of templates to suit your needs. You can discover free and paid templates made by verified creators, and buy templates directly from Marketplace.

## Find templates

You can visit Marketplace by going to `Templates` in your Notion sidebar. Once youâ€™re in Marketplace, youâ€™ll see lots of recommendations. These showcase templates by use case, popularity, and more. You can also see specific templates by choosing `Work`, `Life`, and `School` at the top of the page, or using the search bar.

Underneath each template, youâ€™ll see how many times that template has been added, and how much it costs. Click on a template to see the following information:

* What the template includes and what it can be used for

* Who created it

* Reviews of the template from users and the templateâ€™s overall rating

* How many times the template was added

* How recently the template was updated

* The categories the template belongs to

* The Notion features included in the template

## Add a template

**Note:**

* You must be logged in and using Notion on desktop or web to add a template.

* Purchases can only be made in U.S. dollars (USD).

* At this time, you can only make a purchase using a credit card.

* Marketplace purchases canâ€™t be exempted from sales tax.

Youâ€™ll find both free and paid templates on Marketplace. Once you find a template you like, you can select `Add` (if the template is free) or select `Buy for {price}` at the top of the page to add the template to your workspace.

If the template creator is selling a paid template on a third-party platform, youâ€™ll be directed there. Follow the prompts to complete your purchase.

If the template creator is selling the template directly in Marketplace, follow these steps to complete your purchase:

1. Choose where in your workspace youâ€™d like the template duplicated, like your private pages or a certain teamspace.

2. Enter your billing information.

3. If you have a coupon, enter the coupon code. Note that coupons may expire, and you canâ€™t use more than one coupon per purchase.

4. Check the box to agree to Notionâ€™s terms and conditions, as well as our 14-day return policy.

5. If the creator has requested your email address, check the box to allow them to add you to their mailing list. You can opt-out of email communications at any time, and if you have any questions or concerns about emails from creators, you can reach out to email protected.

6. Select `Add` or `Buy for {price}`.

After you make a purchase, youâ€™ll see a message on your screen that the purchase was successful, and another message that the template is ready for use in your workspace. If your purchase doesnâ€™t go through, you wonâ€™t be able to duplicate the template into your workspace.

**Note:**

* Once youâ€™ve added your template to your workspace, it can be duplicated multiple times in that Notion workspace. However, the creator may have chosen to prevent you from moving the template to another workspace using Move to or by sharing. This means duplicating the template to another workspace or copying certain blocks from the template and pasting them into a page in another Notion workspace wonâ€™t be allowed.

* If you add a template that contains a form, make sure you set up a separate version of the form from scratch so that all of your form responses go to you and not the original formâ€™s creator.

* After youâ€™ve duplicated a template to your workspace, you might see some blocks that say `No access`. These blocks are most likely not meant to be part of the template, and you can delete them from your workspace.

## Manage your templates

To manage the templates youâ€™ve added to your workspace, open Marketplace by going to `Templates` in your Notion sidebar and select `Added` at the top of the page. Youâ€™ll see a list of all of the templates that have been added to your workspace, along with who added them, how much was paid, and when they were added. From here, you can take several actions on a template.

**Note:** Only templates youâ€™ve added or purchased directly on Marketplace will show up in the `Added` menu. Templates that you add or purchase on third-party platforms wonâ€™t be included.

### Review a template

To review a template that youâ€™ve added:

1. Select `â€¢â€¢â€¢` next to the template.

2. Select `Leave a review`.

3. Follow the prompts to write your review. Make sure that the review is related to the template you added, doesnâ€™t contain profanity or inappropriate content, and is easy to understand. Reviews in violation of these guidelines may not be published.

### Contact the creator

To contact the templateâ€™s creator:

1. Select `â€¢â€¢â€¢` next to the template.

2. Select `Contact creator`.

### Request a refund

**Note:**

* Our Marketplace refund policy only applies to **purchases made on Marketplace**. If youâ€™ve purchased a Notion template through a third party, youâ€™ll have to reach out to them for help with your purchase.

* Notion doesnâ€™t issue partial refunds.

* Review our Marketplace [refund policy](https://www.notion.com/help/finding-templates-on-marketplace#marketplace-refund-policy) to make sure youâ€™re eligible for a refund.

Youâ€™re able to get a refund within 14 days of a purchase. Once a refund is processed:

* All copies of the template in your workspace, including inside private pages, will be removed.

* Any copied sections of the template, including specific pages, databases, buttons, and other blocks, will be removed.

* Any edits and additions made to the template, **including new pages you created inside the template,** will be removed.

To request a refund:

1. Select `â€¢â€¢â€¢` next to the template that youâ€™ve purchased.

2. Select `Request refund`. You wonâ€™t see this option if you didnâ€™t purchase this template yourself.

3. Read over the warnings and select `Continue with refund`.

4. Provide a reason for your refund request and select `Continue`.

Once your refund request is submitted, weâ€™ll email you to let you know whether your refund has been approved or declined. If your refund is approved, youâ€™ll receive your funds within a few business days.

If you change your mind and no longer want to refund your template, you can select `â€¢â€¢â€¢` next to the template. Next to `Refund requested`, select `Cancel`, then `Yes, cancel my refund`.

## Marketplace refund policy

You are eligible for a refund if you initiate a refund request within 14 days of purchase. Notion reserves the right to decline a refund request if we detect abusive behavior, such as excessive refund requests within a certain time period. If you live in a region with a mandatory refund policy, Notion will honor any timelines or guidelines specified by that policy.
