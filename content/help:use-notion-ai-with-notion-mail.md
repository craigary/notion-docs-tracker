**Note:**

* Everyone can try Notion Mail‚Äôs AI features for free. Once you‚Äôre ready to unlock unlimited access, you‚Äôll need to purchase the Notion AI add-on for your Notion workspace following the instructions [here ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/purchase-add-ons#notion-ai-add-on)

* If you're using Notion Mail with an email that isn't connected to a workspace that has Notion AI, [change your email](https://www.notion.com/help/account-settings#change-your-email-address) in your Notion AI-enabled workspace to the one you're using with Notion Mail. You'll then be able to use Notion AI features in Notion Mail.

* If you want to use Notion AI features in Notion Mail with multiple email addresses, each of those email addresses will need to be connected to a Notion workspace that has the Notion AI add-on. This means that you can purchase the add-on for each of your Notion accounts that you want to use Notion Mail with, or add your desired email addresses as members in an existing Notion workspace that has Notion AI added. Note that these are billable actions.

## Label emails

**Note:&#x20;**&#x41;t this time, Notion AI can only add labels to new emails. Notion AI won‚Äôt add labels to emails that were in your inbox before your label was created. Notion AI also doesn't work on existing labels you've already created; it only works on labels you create using Notion AI.

Notion AI can filter through your incoming emails, adding certain labels to them and saving them as a view. For example, you can ask Notion AI to label all of your purchase-related emails as `Purchases`. You could also tag emails from specific senders or email domains. To use Notion AI to auto label your future emails:

1. Click `Auto label` at the top of your inbox.

2. Enter a prompt for Notion AI to follow to label your mail. Alternatively, pick a suggestion in the window that opens.

3. Once you‚Äôve finished writing your prompt, select `Split {label description}` if you want all emails with that label to be moved out of your Inbox and only accessible via their own view. Select `Keep {label description}` if you want to keep all emails with that label in your Inbox, as well as in their own view.

4. Notion AI will give you a sample of your emails based on your label name or prompt. Select `‚úÖ` next to the ones that are most relevant to your prompt.

5. Before you create your label, click the current label name and inbox behavior to make any changes.

6. Select `Save`. This will automatically create a view in your sidebar with relevant emails included.

Once you‚Äôve asked Notion AI to sort your mail in this way, a new view will be created in your `Views` that shows a filtered version of your mail with only the relevant Notion AI auto label applied.

You can also create an auto label with a specific email open. Let's say you have an email from your favorite clothing brand open in Notion Mail and want future emails from similar brands to be auto labeled. To do this:

1. With an email open, click `Auto label similar` at the top.

2. Notion AI will give you a sample of your emails based on your label name or prompt. Select `‚úÖ` next to the ones that are most relevant to your prompt.

3. Before you create your label, click the current label name and inbox behavior to make any changes.

4. Select `Save`. This will automatically create a view in your sidebar with relevant emails included.

### Edit an existing auto label

If you want to change the description for an existing auto label:

1. Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notion AI`.

2. Select ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ next to the label you want to edit ‚Üí `Edit`.

3. Provide details about what kind of emails you want your auto label applied to.

4. Select `Save` ‚Üí `Confirm`.

Changes to your auto label will be applied to all your future emails moving forward.

### Improve auto labels

You can help improve your auto labels by manually applying an auto label to or removing an auto label from a specific email.

## Write with Notion AI

While you're drafting an email, Notion AI can help you write your message in just moments. In your composer, type `space` to pull up a window where you can prompt Notion AI to help you write. You can even @-mention a Notion page from the workspace that‚Äôs tied to your Notion Mail account to be used as context for Notion AI to create a draft.

## Draft emails

Soon, you can prompt Notion AI to draft entire email responses on your behalf.
