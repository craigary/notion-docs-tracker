**Note:**

* Everyone can try Notion Mail‚Äôs AI features for free. Once you‚Äôre ready to unlock unlimited access, you‚Äôll need to upgrade to Notion's Business or Enterprise Plan.

* If you're using Notion Mail with an email that isn't connected to a workspace that has Notion AI, [change your email](https://www.notion.com/help/account-settings#change-your-email-address) in your Notion AI-enabled workspace to the one you're using with Notion Mail. You'll then be able to use Notion AI features in Notion Mail.

* If you want to use Notion AI features in Notion Mail with multiple email addresses, each of those email addresses will need to be connected to a Notion workspace that has the Notion AI add-on. This means that you can purchase the add-on for each of your Notion accounts that you want to use Notion Mail with, or add your desired email addresses as members in an existing Notion workspace that has Notion AI added. Note that these are billable actions.

## Label emails

Notion AI can filter through your incoming emails, adding certain labels to them and saving them as a view. For example, you can ask Notion AI to label all of your purchase-related emails as `Purchases`. You could also tag emails from specific senders or email domains. To use Notion AI to auto label your future emails:

1. Click `Auto label` at the top of your inbox.

2. Select from a suggested label or select `Create` to make your own.

3. Enter a name for your label, along with instructions for Notion AI to use to identify emails that you want to label.

4. Select `‚¨ÜÔ∏è`. Notion AI will give you a sample of your emails matching your label name and instructions.

5. Select `Continue`.

6. If you want Notion AI to label your past emails, open the dropdown menu under `Do you want to auto label past emails?` and select a time frame.

7. Select `Show in inbox` if you want to keep all emails with your label in your Inbox, as well as in their own view. Select `Filter from inbox` if you want all emails with your label to be moved out of your Inbox and only accessible via their own view.

8. Select `Save`. This will automatically create a view in your sidebar with relevant emails included.

You can also create an auto label with a specific email open. Let's say you have an email from your favorite clothing brand open in Notion Mail and want future emails from similar brands to be auto labeled. To do this:

1. With an email open, click `Auto label similar` at the top.

2. Notion AI will give you a sample of your emails based on your label name or prompt. Select `‚úÖ` next to the ones that are most relevant to your prompt.

3. Before you create your label, click the current label name and inbox behavior to make any changes.

4. Select `Save`. This will automatically create a view in your sidebar with relevant emails included.

### Edit an existing auto label

If you want to change the description for an existing auto label:

1. Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notion AI`.

2. Select `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` next to the label you want to edit ‚Üí `Edit`.

3. Update your label‚Äôs name and instructions.

4. Select `‚¨ÜÔ∏è`. Notion AI will give you a sample of your emails matching your label name and instructions.

5. If you‚Äôd like, toggle on `Re-label past emails` and select a time frame to have Notion AI label your emails based on any updated instructions. You can also toggle on `Remove labels` to have Notion AI take the label off of any emails that no longer match your updated instructions.

6. Select `Save` ‚Üí `Confirm`.

Changes to your auto label will be applied to all your future emails moving forward.

### Improve auto labels

You can help improve your auto labels by manually applying an auto label to or removing an auto label from a specific email.

## Write with Notion AI

While you're drafting an email, Notion AI can help you write your message in just moments. In your composer, type `space` to pull up a window where you can prompt Notion AI to help you write. You can even @-mention a Notion page from the workspace that‚Äôs tied to your Notion Mail account to be used as context for Notion AI to create a draft.

## Draft emails
