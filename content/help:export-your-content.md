3. A window will pop up in the center of your screen asking which format you want to download the page in. SelectÂ `PDF`Â from the dropdown menu.

7. ClickÂ `Export`. You'll be asked where you want to save the file and it will download as a PDF.

8. If you're on a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan, you can switch on theÂ `Include subpages`Â option. This will generate a zip file containing all the pages nested inside the current page as PDF files. Notion will send you an email with a link to download this file.

## Print a Notion page

### On your browser

2. Select the printer you'd like to use, or chooseÂ `Save as PDF`.

3. The latter will download a PDF file of the Notion page to your computer.

**Note:**Â You cannot print a full-page database this way. You'll need to export it as a PDF first and then print the PDF file.

### On the desktop app

There is no way to print directly from the Notion desktop app. You'll need to export your page or database as a PDF first and then print that file. Full instructions on exporting to PDF can be found [above](https://www.notion.com/help/export-your-content#export-as-pdf).

## Export your entire workspace

**Note:&#x20;**&#x54;o verify a domain for your organization, you must be an [organization owner](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls).

Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.

If you're on a Business or Enterprise Plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.

Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace admins on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.

A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.

To export your workspace content:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Under `Workspace`, select `General`.

3. Find and select `Export all workspace content`.

4. You'll receive an email from Notion with a link to download your files. This link will expire after 7 days.

   * Exports can take up to 30 hours to process, depending on the size of the workspace.

If a user's email notifications are turned off, they will not receive the export link via email. Instead, the link will be delivered to their in-app inbox.

**Note:**

* You can only export your entire workspace on desktop or web.

* You canâ€™t instantly recreate your workspace by reuploading your exported workspace content.


## FAQs

### I'm not seeing an export option in my â€¢â€¢â€¢ menu. What's the deal?

If youâ€™re a member of an Enterprise workspace, it's possible that your workspace or teamspace owner has disabled exporting. To allow members to export content:

* Workspaces owners can go to `Settings` â†’ `Security`, then toggle off `Disable export`.

* Teamspace owners can go to `Settings` â†’ `Teamspaces` â†’ `â€¢â€¢â€¢` next to your teamspace â†’ `Security`, then toggle off `Disable export`.

If you're a guest of the workspace, you need to have `Full access` to the page or database to see and use the export option.


### Why don't I see my export downloading right away?

If a file is very large (depending on the number of sub-pages included), we may send you an email with a download link rather than automatically starting a download. This is not always the case. No email will be sent if you were able to download the file right away.


### Can I export all of my database views?

When exporting a database, you can only choose between the current view and the default view. Exporting all views at once isnâ€™t supported.


### My Windows computer cannot open the exported ZIP file. Why is that?

This issue occurs because Windows has a limitation on the maximum file path length â€” by default, paths longer than **260 characters** cannot be handled properly.

When exporting, Notion creates nested folders for subpages. If the combined folder and file names exceed this limit, Windows may fail to open or extract the ZIP file.

There are a couple ways to fix this problem:

* **Option 1:** When exporting, uncheck the option `Create folders for subpages`. This keeps all pages and files in a single folder, reducing the total path length.

* **Option 2:** Use a tool like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the ZIP file. 7-Zip is more robust and can handle long file paths that Windows Explorer cannot.
