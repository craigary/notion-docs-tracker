## FAQs

### Which offer can I receive?

If you’re affiliated with one of our partners **and** meet the program requirements, you may be eligible for **6 months free** of Notion’s **Business Plan** (including Notion AI). If you’re not affiliated with a partner but still meet the requirements, you may be eligible for **3 months free** of the **Business Plan** (including Notion AI).

If you’re an **SMB (including service-based businesses)** or have **fewer than 10 employees**, you may be eligible for a **1 month** offer instead. This typically applies when a company doesn’t meet our startup eligibility criteria or we’re unable to fully verify startup status based on the information provided.

Submit our [form](https://www.notion.com/startups-apply) to check your eligibility.


### What are the program requirements? 

We offer different trial lengths depending on your eligibility and how you apply (partner-affiliated vs. non-partner). If you **work with one of our partners** and want to be considered for the **6 month** offer, you must:

* Have a **valid Notion domain**.

* Have **fewer than 100 employees**.

Incomplete or unclear information (e.g., an inactive website, limited company presence, or insufficient business details) can also impact our ability to verify eligibility.

### Why did I receive a 1 month trial instead of 3 or 6 months?

You received a 1 month trial because either:

1. **You have under 10 employees** – SMBs with fewer than 10 employees receive our 1 month trial offer, or

2. **You're an SMB or service-based business** rather than a startup, or

3. **We couldn't fully verify your startup status** with the information provided in your application

The 3 month and 6 month offers are designed specifically for **startups** building scalable tech-related products or services. SMBs, service-based businesses, consultancies, agencies, and companies under 10 employees receive the 1 month trial.

You may have also received a 1 month trial if one or more of the following apply:

* **Inactive or incomplete website:** Your website appears to be a domain parking page, shows errors, or doesn't clearly describe your business

* **Limited business presence:** Only personal social media profiles were provided instead of company pages

* **Insufficient information:** Not enough details were available to verify your business legitimacy

* **Solo applicant:** The application suggests a single individual rather than a company
