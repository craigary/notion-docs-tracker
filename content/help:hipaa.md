The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US federal law that was enacted in 1996 that requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates.

This article provides users required product configurations to make their Notion workspace HIPAA compliant.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x4E;otion's Business Associate Agreement (BAA) governs the protection of Personal Health Information (PHI) that is stored in the Notion Service. To be eligible to sign Notion‚Äôs BAA, you must subscribe to our Enterprise Plan.

Any Beta Services are not covered by the BAA and therefore may not be used or deployed in a manner that processes protected health information.

| **Access Control**Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Notion‚Äôs SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.**To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you'll need to complete the following steps:****Verify domain(s):*****&#x20;***&#x54;o use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain‚Äôs DNS to verify your ownership of it.**Enable SAML SSO:*****&#x20;***&#x54;his will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer to [this article](https://www.notion.com/help/saml-sso-configuration).**Change default login method:*****&#x20;***&#x4F;nce SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set to¬†`Any method`, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this to `Only SAML SSO`, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.**Link additional workspaces:*****&#x20;***&#x49;f you have more than one workspace you‚Äôd like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out to¬†email protected.Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there‚Äôs an IdP/SAML SSO failure. |
| **Unique User Identification**Assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups.

## Enable HIPAA compliance

To enable HIPAA compliance for your workspace:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Workspace settings` ‚Üí `HIPAA compliance` ‚Üí `Activate`.

2. A window will appear where you can read the full signed BAA before you select `Accept`.

3. Once you‚Äôve accepted, you‚Äôll see confirmation that HIPAA compliance has been enabled. You‚Äôll also receive an email confirming that your workspace has accepted the HIPAA BAA.

## Deactivate HIPAA compliance

If you‚Äôd like to turn off HIPAA compliance for your workspace:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Workspace settings` ‚Üí `HIPAA compliance` ‚Üí `Deactivate`.

2. In the window that appears, select `Disable`.

3. Once you‚Äôve accepted, you‚Äôll see confirmation that HIPAA compliance has been disabled. This means you can no longer store Protected Health Information (PHI) in your Notion workspace. You‚Äôll also receive a confirmation email.
