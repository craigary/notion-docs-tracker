## What happens when you delete your account

When you delete your account:

* The action is permanent. You might want to [export](https://www.notion.com/help/export-your-content) any data that you want to keep after you delete the account.

* Any private workspaces in which you were the only member will be deleted.

* Any shared workspaces in which you were the only admin will be deleted.

* Any deleted workspaces will be deleted for everyone in them. This means all users who were part of a workspace before it was deleted will no longer have access to that workspace or any content inside that workspace.

* Youâ€™ll be removed from any shared workspaces in which you were a member or one of multiple admins.

* You wonâ€™t be able to access any content from workspaces that are deleted or that you are removed from â€” even your private pages.

Youâ€™ll see a warning about which of your workspaces will be deleted when you try to delete your account.
