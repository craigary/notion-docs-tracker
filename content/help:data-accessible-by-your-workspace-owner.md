If you are accessing any Notion workspace using an email address or account assigned to you by your employer or other organization (for example, you use your work email to access a workspace administered by your employer), it is important to note that the workspace owner could have access to the data you store in that Notion workspace, including any private pages in that workspace. Additionally, the workspace owner can turn off Notion services or restrict your ability to move data to or from the organizational workspace. Please read our [Terms of Service](https://www.notion.com/notion/Personal-Use-Terms-of-Service-00e4e5d0f2b9411cbee6493f15779500#b94e690018dd497fa87c02801dd32170) for more information.

If you access Notion with an email address or account assigned to you by your employer or other organization, your agreement or legal relationship with that workspace owner might affect:

* Who owns the data or content that you submit or upload through your account

* The conditions under which you may access your account or when your account may be disable.

* Who may access or delete the data in your account.

Please note, whenever you access an **Enterprise** Plan workspace (as a member or a guest), the workspace owners will have access to the data you store in that Notion workspace.

Visit `Settings` in your workspace to view the workspace owners of your account.

You can also access Notion for free, for personal use outside of your managed account, by signing up with your personal email here: <https://www.notion.com/signup>.
