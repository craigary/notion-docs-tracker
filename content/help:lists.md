## FAQs

### How can I turn a full-page database into an inline database, or vice versa?

To change a full-page database into an inline database:

1. Drag the full-page database from your sidebar into another page. It will become a sub-page of that page.

2. Open the parent page, click the **`⋮⋮`** button next to the database sub-page, and select `Turn into inline`.

To change an inline database to a full-page database, drag an inline database block into your sidebar as a top-level page.


### I don’t want my database pages to open on the side or in the center of my page. Is there anyway to open a database page in full-screen by default?

Yes! To do this:

1. Open the settings menu at the top of your database.

2. Select `Layout` → `Open pages in` → `Full page`.
