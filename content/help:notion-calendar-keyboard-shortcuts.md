In Notion Calendar for desktop or web, use the keyboard shortcut `?` to pull up a list of all of the keyboard shortcuts you can use. You can also search for a specific shortcut.

There are also global Notion Calendar keyboard shortcuts, which you can use even when you’re in a different app and Notion Calendar is running in the background. To see and change these shortcuts:

* Go to `Settings` → `Menu bar` → `System-wide keyboard shortcuts`.

* You’ll see your default shortcuts for showing and hiding the menu bar, as well as joining a meeting. You can customize these shortcuts by selecting the existing shortcut and entering your own.
