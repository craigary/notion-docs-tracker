## What happens when you delete a workspace

Once a workspace is deleted:

* This action is permanent.

* All of the content inside of it will be deleted. You won‚Äôt be able to access your content ‚Äî even your private pages. You might want to [export](https://www.notion.com/help/export-your-content) any data that you want to keep after you delete the workspace.

* The deleted workspace will be deleted for everyone in it. This means all users who were part of a workspace before it was deleted will no longer have access to that workspace or any content inside that workspace.

* You'll be returned to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any others.

## Delete a workspace

To delete a workspace:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Under `Workspace`, select `General`.

3. Scroll down to `Danger zone` and select `Delete entire workspace`. You'll be asked to type the name of your workspace to confirm you want to proceed.
