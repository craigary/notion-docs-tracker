## Accepted payment methods

On Notion for web, you can pay for your plan with a debit or credit card, or Apple Pay. If you're in Europe, we also accept payment through SEPA direct debit (not credit transfer). You can also use [Stripe Link](https://stripe.com/payments/link) to pay with a saved card or save your card for future use on any Stripe checkout. Notion usesÂ [Stripe](http://stripe.com/)Â to process payments.

On an iOS device, you can pay with Apple Pay. Unfortunately, you can't make payments in the Android app at this time.

If you pay with debit or credit card, you're charged upfront for the month or year you're about to spend on Notion. If you pay with SEPA direct debit, youâ€™ll receive a debit notification email.

Payments for subscriptions you purchase on mobile can be managed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. If you've purchased a subscription through the Apple App Store, you'll need to contact the Apple App Store directly for any issues with your subscription, including cancellations and refunds.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x41;ll valid billing credits will expire six months from the date they are generated. Once credits have expired, they canâ€™t be reinstated.

### SEPA

If youâ€™re using SEPA for the first time to pay for your Notion plan, note that payment must fully process before you can make any changes to your plan, add or remove AI, or update your payment method. We also wonâ€™t be able to assist with refunds while your payment is processing.

You can, however, add or remove members from your workspace during this time. These changes will be reflected in your next invoice.
