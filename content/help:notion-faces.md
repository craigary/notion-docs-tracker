With Notion Faces, you can choose from a variety of facial features and accessories to create a Notion-style portrait that you can use as your profile picture, share with others, and more.

## Access Notion Faces

To make your own Notion Faces portrait, use your web browser on desktop or mobile to open [faces.notion.com](http://faces.notion.com?from=marketing\&pathname=/help/notion-faces). Anyone can use Notion Faces ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to be logged into Notion!

## Create and customize your portrait

Once you‚Äôre in the Notion Faces portrait maker, you can select `üîÄ` to generate a random portrait, or you can select New portrait to create a portrait from scratch.

You‚Äôll be able to personalize your portrait by selecting your skin tone, eyes, brows, eyewear, nose, mouth, hair, and accessories.

Once you‚Äôre happy with your portrait, select `Save` at the top of the page. You can optionally customize your portrait with a headline (like your name), a caption, and a background color and select `Continue`. Otherwise, you can select `Skip`.

You can `Download` your customized portrait (with its headline, caption, and background) or just your portrait by itself. You‚Äôll also be able to explore portraits from other Notion users and even open Notion directly from Notion Faces to use your new portrait as your Notion profile picture.
