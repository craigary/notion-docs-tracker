If you can’t access your own Notion page and you’re prompted to request access to it:

* If you have multiple Notion accounts or you’ve recently changed your email, make sure you’re logged into the correct Notion account. You’ll need to be accessing the page using the account that you used to create the page.

* It’s possible your page has been moved or your page’s permissions have been changed by a workspace admin. Ask someone to restore your access to your page.

* If you get an error telling you to try again when you click to request access to the page, this could mean there’s a bug. Try accessing the document from a different browser or clear your cache and open the page again.
