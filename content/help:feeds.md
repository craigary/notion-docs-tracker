Feed view displays database pages as a linear, stacked cards format, like a blog or social media site, making it easy to browse and engage with team content. Feed view is great for team updates, project status sharing, or any other company communications.

This layout turns any database into an interactive feed, allowing users to:

* S<!-- -->croll and browse content seamlessly.

* C<!-- -->omment on any post directly.

* Track views on their posts.

## Create feed view
