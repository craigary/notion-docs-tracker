## How you can use Notion Calendar with Notion

You can integrate Notion Calendar with Notion to:

* Add Notion pages to your events.

* View and manage Notion databases in your calendar, as long as the databases have a date property.

* Connect [AI Meeting Notes](https://www.notion.com/help/ai-meeting-notes) to your events.

## Connect Notion workspaces to Notion Calendar

To connect your Notion workspaces to Notion Calendar:

1. Open Notion Calendar on desktop or web.

2. Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notion`.

3. Next to `Add Notion workspace`, select `Connect`.

4. Give Notion Calendar access to Notion by selecting `Allow access`. If the integration is successful, you‚Äôll see it appear in your settings.

**Note:**

* If you have multiple workspaces, you need to connect them individually to Notion Calendar, even if those workspaces are associated with the same email address.

* A workspace admin can‚Äôt turn on Notion Calendar for everyone in their Notion workspace. Notion Calendar and Notion must be connected at the user level.

* Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî connecting Notion Calendar and Notion doesn‚Äôt mean your company will have access to your calendars.

## Add AI Meeting Notes and pages to your Notion Calendar event

When you create an event in Notion Calendar, you‚Äôll see an `AI Meeting Notes and Docs` field in the event. Click into this field to add meeting notes or another Notion page to the event details. From here, you can:

* Create an [AI Meeting Notes](https://www.notion.com/help/ai-meeting-notes) page for the event. You can adjust your AI Meeting Notes settings by clicking your profile icon ‚Üí `Settings` ‚Üí `AI Meeting Notes`. From here, you can:

  * Adjust the location for meeting notes.

  * Select to auto-share to share meeting notes with internal participants.

  * Select to auto-add meeting notes to new events.

* Make a new Notion page by selecting `Add blank Notion page`. Give your page a title and indicate where you want that page to live, and in which Notion workspace. Select `Create` when you‚Äôre done.

* Choose an existing Notion page by searching for it, or selecting an option from `Recent Notion pages`. You can also switch between Notion workspaces if you have more than one connected to Notion Calendar.

* Once you attach a Notion page to an event, you‚Äôll be able to access it quickly and easily before a meeting, both from inside Notion Calendar and your menu bar.

## Connect Notion database entries to Notion Calendar

**Note:** To be connected to Notion Calendar, a Notion database must have a date property.

You might use Notion databases to track important projects or events. You can bring these events directly into Notion Calendar so you can see all of these dates in one place!

View Notion databases from the comfort of your calendar.

### Who can connect a Notion database to Notion Calendar?

To connect a Notion database to Notion Calendar, you must have at least `Can view` access to the database.

To edit or add pages in a database via Notion Calendar, you must have at least `Can edit content` access to the database. Otherwise, you‚Äôll only be able to view database pages in your calendar.

### Add a Notion database to Notion Calendar

To add a Notion database to Notion Calendar:

1. At the bottom of the left sidebar of Notion Calendar, find the Notion workspace that contains the database you want to see in your calendar.

2. Hover over the calendar‚Äôs name, then select `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` ‚Üí `Add Notion database`. Search for and select the database you want to add to your calendar.

3. Dates from your database will appear in your calendar. If your database has multiple date properties, you‚Äôll need to select a primary property that will be used to populate your calendar.

Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `O`, or enter `cmd` + `K` and type ‚Äúshow Notion database‚Äù.

You can also add a Notion database to Notion Calendar **from inside Notion**. Open your database in Notion, click on the name of your database view, and select `Manage in Notion Calendar`.

If you want to add an additional view from a database you‚Äôve already connected to Notion Calendar:

1. Find the database‚Äôs name in the left sidebar of Notion Calendar.

2. Select `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` next to the database‚Äôs name ‚Üí `Add Notion database view`.

3. Select the database view you want to add.

**Note:**

* You can only add a database while using Notion Calendar for desktop or web.

* At the moment, you can only view your Notion database in Notion Calendar, not in Google or iCloud calendar.

* You can add up to 20 databases to Notion Calendar.

* While you can connect an existing Notion database to Notion Calendar, you can‚Äôt turn your Notion Calendar into a Notion database at this time.

* If you‚Äôre not able to see a specific database page in Notion Calendar even though you have access to view the database, it‚Äôs possible that the database page has specific permissions that are different from the permissions for the rest of the database.

## Manage a Notion database in Notion Calendar

Once you‚Äôve connected a Notion database to Notion Calendar, you can manage all of that database‚Äôs pages directly from inside your calendar.

To edit an existing database page from your calendar grid:

1. Select a database item.

2. In the right context panel, change the title, date, and time of your event. You can also edit any of the item‚Äôs select (but not multi-select) properties, like a status property. You can even move the item to another calendar, database, or database view.

You can even manage entire databases using a handy list panel on the left side of Notion Calendar. This can be useful if you‚Äôve integrated a task database with Notion Calendar, and you want to assign tasks to specific dates or update task information without leaving your calendar.

To manage a database in Notion Calendar:

1. Find and click the name of a Notion database in your left sidebar.

2. A new panel will open up showing you all the pages in your database.

   ![hc: list panel](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/3YlG8rC5bev3bSWBH84iX/8e0c1ea633425569c627136d8fefd160/Reference_Visuals_Group_162.png)

From this panel, you can:

* Click `+` at the top of the panel to create a new page in the database. You‚Äôll only be able to do this if you have access to edit the original database in Notion.

* Drag a database item into your calendar grid, or click on it to edit its details from the right context panel. Alternatively, you can hover over the page in the list panel and select `‚úèÔ∏è` to quickly edit the page‚Äôs properties.

  **Note:** The following properties can be edited via Notion Calendar:

  * Title

  * Date

  * Status

  * Select

  * Checkboxes

* Click the slider icon at the top of the panel to:

  * Change the `Color` of the database view as it appears in your calendar.

  * Change `Status filter` so you can see, for example, only pages that are still in progress.

  * Change `Date filter` so you can see, for example, only pages that don‚Äôt yet have a date assigned to them.

  * `Change primary properties` that you want Notion Calendar to look at for that database. This is especially helpful if your database has multiple date or status properties, and you want to view your database using a different date or status property.

* Open the dropdown next to your current database view and add another existing database view, or `Create view in Notion`.

Any changes you make will be reflected in the original database in Notion.

**Note:**

* If the dates for a database you connect to Notion Calendar are generated using the Formula, Created time, or Last edited time properties, those dates will be read-only in Notion Calendar. In other words, you can‚Äôt edit those dates from inside your calendar.

* If you duplicate a Notion database item in Notion Calendar, a new page will be created in your Notion database with the same title and date, but it won‚Äôt duplicate any other content inside the original page.

* If you move a database item from one workspace to another inside of Notion Calendar, a new page will be created in the destination workspace with the same title and date. The original page will be archived in the source Notion workspace and can be [restored](https://www.notion.com/help/duplicate-delete-and-restore-content).

## Make a Notion database your default calendar

If you want all new events you create in Notion Calendar to be added to your Notion database, change your default calendar to the database. To do this, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Calendars` ‚Üí `Default calendar` and pick the database you want to set as your default. On desktop, you can also set a default calendar by clicking the square next to the database‚Äôs name in the left sidebar.

## Disconnect a Notion database from Notion Calendar

To remove a database from Notion Calendar:

1. Find the database‚Äôs name in the left sidebar of Notion Calendar.

2. Select `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` next to the database‚Äôs name ‚Üí `Remove view from list`.

## Upcoming events in Home

Your calendar events can be viewed and joined directly from inside Notion. In Notion, go to `Home` in your sidebar to view your Upcoming events widget. If you haven‚Äôt already used Notion Calendar with Notion, you‚Äôre logged out of Notion Calendar, or you‚Äôre using the widget in a new or different Notion workspace, you can select `Connect Notion Calendar` in the widget to set up your calendar.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x49;f you‚Äôre using Notion for desktop, you may be prompted to sign into your Notion account on the web to set up the Upcoming events widget.

This widget can be customized to show the calendars and events that you want. You can connect multiple Notion Calendar accounts to the Upcoming events widget in Home. If you‚Äôre in multiple Notion workspaces, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you can adjust your Upcoming events widget differently for each!
