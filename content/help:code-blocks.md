## Add a code block

On any Notion page, you can create a code block to display code so that it's broken out from the rest of your content and formatted by language.

* Click the `+` that appears to the left when you hover over a new line. Choose `Code` and press `enter`. Alternatively, type `/code` and press `enter`.

* With your new code block in place, click inside it to type or paste your code.

## Syntax highlighting

We support syntax highlighting for a number of programming languages. To change the display language of your code:

1. Click the name of the language at the top left of the code block.

2. Type in the name of your programming language to search, then press `enter` to select.

## Wrap your code

To eliminate side scrolling and create a line break at the edge of your code block:

1. Hover over the code block and click `•••` at the top right or `⋮⋮` on the left. You can also right click on the block itself.

2. Switch on the `Wrap code` option.

## Copy or add a caption to code blocks

Hover over your code block to reveal the `Copy` and `Caption` buttons at the top right.

1. Click `Copy`, and your code is ready to paste into your editor or wherever you want to share it.

2. Select `Caption` and enter whatever you want to say about the code!

3. Click the `•••` menu for even more options.
