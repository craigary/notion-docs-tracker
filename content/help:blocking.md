Have a doctorâ€™s appointment that you donâ€™t want a teammate to schedule over? Notion Calendarâ€™s blocking features make it easy to block events across your various calendars. For example, Notion Calendar can put a block on your work calendar for an event you have on your personal calendar, so people know youâ€™re busy without being able to see your personal commitments. You can block single events or auto-block whole calendars.

### Block an event or an entire calendar

On desktop or web:

1. Right-click an event and select `Block on calendar`.

2. Select the calendar you want to create a block in.

3. To create a block for a single event, select `This event`. Alternatively, you can select `All events from {calendar name}` to set up auto-blocking. For example, if you are creating a block on your work calendar for an event on your personal calendar, you can synchronize the two calendars so that all future events from your personal calendar will be blocked on your work calendar.

4. Choose to `Include details` from the original calendar event in the block, or simply `Show as busy`. This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.

If you manage your time across two calendars, like work and personal, use event blocking to automatically block time on each.

To see what details youâ€™ve shared on a calendar block, right-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be a `ðŸ”’`Â next to the calendar where the block was set up â€” if the lock is open, that means the eventâ€™s details have been shared. If the lock is closed, that means the eventâ€™s details are hidden.

Alternatively, you can hide the original calendar from view by selecting the eye icon next to its name in the left sidebar. Then, you can find the block on your other calendar and see its details.

## Remove blocking

You can remove blocks the same way you created them. Right-click a blocked event and unselect the calendar where the block lives. You can unblock a single event, or turn off auto-blocking by unblocking all events.

You may want to undo auto-blocking for a calendar that you no longer have access to. Weâ€™re working to improve this experience, but in the meantime you can reach out to email protected.
