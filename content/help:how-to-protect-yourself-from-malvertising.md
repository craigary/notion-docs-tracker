At Notion, we prioritize the safety and trust of our users. As part of this commitment, we share tips on online safety. One key area of focus is combating "Malvertising", a common cyber threat where online ads are used to distribute malicious software.

Malvertising is a method where cybercriminals misuse online advertising platforms to distribute malware. They accomplish this by creating ads that mimic trusted brands, such as Notion, and deceiving users into downloading their malicious software.

## How does malvertising affect you?

If you accidentally download and install malware thinking it's the official Notion app, your device and personal data may be at risk. This could lead to your account being compromised, personal information getting exposed, and potential data loss.

## Protect yourself from malvertising

1. **Download apps from trusted sources:** Only download the Notion app from the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/), or [Notion‚Äôs website](https://www.notion.com/desktop). Avoid third-party app stores or ad links.

2. **Exercise caution with online ads:** Avoid clicking on ads that seem suspicious or overly enticing. It's safer to ignore ads that are unfamiliar or seem unusual.

3. **Keep your software up-to-date:** Regularly update your device's operating system and apps. These updates often include security enhancements that guard against known vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by malware.

4. **Use security software:** Install trusted security software on your device. Ensure it's always up-to-date and perform regular malware scans.

5. **Stay informed:** Keep up-to-date with the latest cyber threats and effective protection strategies. Knowledge is your strongest defense in cybersecurity. There are various ways to keep yourself informed. Here‚Äôs a [list](https://cybersecurityventures.com/industry-news/) of some excellent sources.

Remember, if you land on a Notion download page, verify it is [notion.com/download](https://www.notion.com/download). If you encounter any activity that seems suspicious and involves Notion, please report it to us via email protected.

Your safety and trust are our top priorities. We continually strive to protect our brand and users from threats. By staying alert and following these steps, you can contribute to this protective effort.
