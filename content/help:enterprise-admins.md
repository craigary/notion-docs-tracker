Workspaces on the Enterprise Plan have a few unique roles that allow for workspace management.

## Organization owner

If your organization has multiple workspaces in Notion, those workspaces can be brought together as one organization. Organization owners are able to view and manage all of their workspaces and members in one central place and apply settings across the board.

## Workspace owner

Workspace owners can manage everything in the workspace from settings and security to members and groups â€” and even delete an entire workspace.

Think of them as the primary administrator of a workspace with the most expansive permissions.

### Membership admin

Membership admins can add or remove members from workspaces, or add or remove members, other membership admins, and workspace owners from existing groups.

Membership admins canâ€™t edit other workspace settings.Note: Membership admins can add users to the workspace in a **member role only**. Membership admins cannot add workspace owners or membership admins to the workspace.

**Note:** Membership admins can only add other **members** to a workspace. They can't designate workspace owners or other membership admins.
