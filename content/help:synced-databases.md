**Note:** To connect third-party apps to Notion AI, you must be on the Business or Enterprise Plan.

Notion Mail is **free to connect** for all plans; youâ€™ll need to sign up for Notion Mail before setting up the connection.

Synced databases allow you to sync data from other platforms as Notion databases. Syncs are continuous but only go one direction, meaning that data changes will need to happen on the original platform in order for updates to appear in Notion.

Platforms include:

* **Jira** boards and projects

* **GitHub** PRs and issues

* **Asana&#x20;**&#x70;rojects and tasks

* **GitLab** merge requests and issues

More apps will be supported in the future!

## Create a synced database

### **Jira**

Learn how to set up a synced database for Jira and what else you can do with our Jira integration [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/jira#synced-databases)

### **GitHub**

Learn how to set up a synced database for GitHub and what else you can do with our GitHub integration [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/github#create-a-synced-database)

### **Asana**

To create a synced database for Asana:

1. In Asana, open your project and copy the project link. Make sure you're not just copying the link in your browser's URL bar.

2. Paste the link into Notion and select `Paste as database`.

   * If you haven't already, you will be prompted to sign in and connect Notion with your Asana account.

3. The synced database will created in a [table view](https://www.notion.com/help/tables), with all Asana properties automatically added.

4. The database will begin populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x53;ynced databases only go in one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in the source (Jira, GitHub, Asana) in order for updates to reflect in Notion.

## Adding a new property to a synced database

You can add any Notion property to a synced database. There are two things to know when adding an additional Notion property onto a synced database.

* If a property is deleted on the third-party app (i.e. you delete a task in Jira), the associated synced database row and all properties will be deleted. They will be accessible in the trash to view what was deleted, but cannot be restored.

* If an added Notion property shares a name with any third-party properties (Jira, GitHub, GitLab, or Asana), that property will not sync.

### People properties in synced databases

Synced databases will include people properties! Now, you can use identity mapping to connect third party [GitHub](https://www.notion.com/help/github#create-a-synced-database) and [Jira](https://www.notion.com/help/jira#synced-databases) identities to your team's Notion profiles.
