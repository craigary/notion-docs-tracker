## What is Marketplace?

Notionâ€™s [Marketplace](https://www.notion.com/marketplace) is the trusted place to find inspiration and help for your Notion setup. Notion users can find Notion templates and Notion partner solutions through the Marketplace.

Partners work with individuals, teams, small businesses, and enterprises â€” from basic workspace setup to large-scale enterprise implementations.

Depending on your certifications and what type of partner you are, the services you offer through Marketplace may include workflow design, workspace architecture, training, change management, API development, integrations, and license resell (Solutions Partners only).

## Create and manage your services, leads, and projects

Certified partners can submit their profile through the Partner Portal. After review, your profile will appear in the Partner Directory so customers can find and contact you. You can set your listing to inactive anytime.

You can edit your description, certifications, and contact info anytime in the Partner Portal.

## Group members

When you set up your profile in Marketplace to offer services, youâ€™ll be able to add multiple members to that profile so you can work together to sell your services on Marketplace.

There can be up to 10 total members in a profile, made up of various roles:

* Owner: There can only be one owner per group. Owners can add and remove members, as well as change the roles of other group members or transfer their ownership to another member. They can also edit the Marketplace profile.

* Admins: Admins can remove members and other admins from the group. They can also edit the Marketplace profile.

* Members: Members can only view the Marketplace profile. They canâ€™t add or remove any members.

To add a group member, youâ€™ll need to be the owner or admin for the profile. Then, youâ€™ll want to:

1. Go to [notion.com/profile/services](http://notion.com/profile/services) and select `Add member` under `Group members`.

2. Follow the prompts to invite someone via email as an admin or member.

Once youâ€™ve invited a member, theyâ€™ll need to sign up for Notion or log in with an existing Notion account to become part of your Marketplace profile.


## FAQs

### How do I get matched with leads? How do I get higher-quality leads?

Showcase a strong profile with past work, a list of clients, and reviews. Marketing your services in other channels outside of the Marketplace can also help to bring in business.

For the best lead quality, keep your profile detailed and up to date, participate in enablement training, and provide feedback to Partner Support on the leads you receive.
