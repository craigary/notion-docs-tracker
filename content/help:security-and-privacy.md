## Data security

* **Access monitoring:** Notion has enabled logging on all critical systems. Logs include failed/successful logs, application access, administrator changes, and system changes. Logs are ingested by our observability and security incident event management (SIEM) solution for log ingestion and automated logging/alerting capabilities.

* **Backups enabled**: Notion is hosted by AWS and stores customer data using a combination of databases. By default, AWS provides durable infrastructure to store important data and is designed for durability of 99.9% of objects. Automated backups of all customer and system data is enabled, and data is backed up daily at minimum. The backups are encrypted in the same way as live production data, and are monitored and alerted.

* **Data erasure:** Notion customers are Controllers of their data. Each customer is responsible for the information they create, use, store, process and destroy. Notion customers have the ability to request data deletion or self-serve their own deletion, when data is not subject to regulatory or legal retention periodicity requirements. Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.notion.com/notion/Privacy-Policy-3468d120cf614d4c9014c09f6adc9091) and [Data Processing Addendum](https://www.notion.com/notion/Data-Processing-Addendum-361b540101274b1fa7e16b90402b0d99) for more information.

* **Encryption at rest:** Customer data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Customer data is encrypted when on Notionâ€™s internal networks, at rest in Cloud storage, database tables, and backups.

* **Encryption in transit:** Data sent in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or greater.

* **Physical security:** Notion leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host our application, and defers all data center physical security controls to them. Please refer to [AWSâ€™s physical security controls here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/controls/).

## Application security

* **Responsible disclosure:&#x20;**&#x4E;otion maintains a bug bounty program. Please refer to our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.notion.com/Responsible-Disclosure-Policy-5f18bb6b86804eaf989c006131778b9c).

* **Code analysis:** Notion security and development teams conduct threat modeling and secure design reviews for new releases and updates. After code completion for significant feature launches, we perform code audits, code reviews, and conduct security scans for our codebase.

* **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):&#x20;**&#x4E;otion uses a defined SDLC to ensure that code is written securely. During the design phase, security threat modeling and secure design reviews are performed for new releases and updates. After code completion for significant feature launches, we perform code audits, work with vendor companies or drive an internal penetration test, and conduct security scans for our codebase. After launch, we host bug bounties and have a vulnerability management program to address severe security issues.

* **Credential management:** Notion uses a third party Key Management Services (KMS) that automatically manages key generation, access control, secure storage, backup, and rotation of keys. Cryptographic keys are assigned to specific roles based on least privilege access and keys are automatically rotated yearly. Usage of keys is monitored and logged.

* **Vulnerability & patch management:** Notion performs vulnerability scanning and package monitoring on all infrastructure related hosts, and the company product continuously. Externally and internally-facing services are patched on a regular schedule. Any issues that are discovered are triaged and resolved according to the severity within Notionâ€™s environment.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** All public endpoints leverage a managed Web Application Firewall to deter attempts to exploit common vulnerabilities.

## Security profile

* **Data Access Level:&#x20;**&#x49;nternal (i.e. Notion employees will only ever access your data for the purposes of troubleshooting problems or recovering content on your behalf.)

* **Third Party Dependence:** Yes - please refer to our list of subprocessors [here](https://www.notion.com/notion/Notion-s-List-of-Subprocessors-268fa5bcfa0f46b6bc29436b21676734).

* **Hosting:** Notion is hosted on one Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the major cloud service providers.

* **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Estimated at 2 hours

* **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Estimated at 24 hours

## Corporate security

* **Employee training:** Security training is required during the employee onboarding process, and annually thereafter. Employees also must read and acknowledge Notionâ€™s Code of Conduct and the Security policy. Developer training is also conducted on at least an annual basis.

* **HR security:** Notion performs background checks on employees when they are hired in accordance with local laws and regulations.

* **Incident response:** Notion has an incident management plan which contains steps for preparation, identification, containment, investigation, eradication, recovery, and follow-up/postmortem that is reviewed and tested annually at least.

* **Internal assessments:&#x20;**&#x49;nternal security audits are performed at least annually at Notion.

* **Internal SSO:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all Notion employees to log into Notionâ€™s identity provider.

## Access control

* **Data access:&#x20;**&#x4E;otion internally leverages the principle of Least Privilege for access. Access is granted based on job function, business requirements, and a need to know basis. Access reviews are conducted on a set frequency to ensure continued access to critical systems are still required.

* **Logging:** Notion leverages a SIEM solution for log ingestion and automated logging/alerting capabilities. Logs are ingested from critical systems and alerting rules are utilized to ensure security event alerts are generated where/when necessary.

* **Password Security:&#x20;**&#x4E;otion requires MFA to be enabled for any and all systems that provide the option for MFA). When such delegation is not possible, Notion maintains a stringent internal password management policy including complexity, and length.

## Infrastructure

* **Anti-DDoS:&#x20;**&#x4E;otion leverages third party applications for DDoS protection.

* **Data Center:** Notion is hosted on AWS, who handles physical security to data centers. Please refer to AWSâ€™s security documentation [here](https://aws.amazon.com/security/).

* **Infrastructure Security:** Notionâ€™s infrastructure is hosted in a fully redundant, secured environment. Notionâ€™s customer data is hosted by AWS. AWS maintains a list of reports, certifications, and third party assessments to ensure best security practices. For more information on AWS compliance, please see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/).\
  AWS infrastructure is housed in an Amazon controlled data centers throughout the world, and the data centers themselves are secured with a variety of physical controls to prevent unauthorized access. More information on AWS data centers and their security controls can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/data-centers/).

* **Separate Production Environment:** Customer data is never stored in non-production environments. Customer accounts are logically separated in our production environment. We have separate development, testing and production environments.

## Endpoint security

* **Disk Encryption:** Employee laptops have disk encryption enabled for protection

* **Endpoint Detection & Response:** All endpoints have detection software installed. Additionally, Notion has implemented multiple security controls to ensure the security of customer data and solutions. These controls ensure we have ongoing visibility of what our end point is doing, that we can detect and react quickly to any tampering or threats as well as, logging and enforcement controls.

* **Mobile Device Management:&#x20;**&#x45;mployee devices and their software configuration are managed remotely by members of the IT and security team via MDM software.

* **Threat Detection:** Notion utilizes a third party endpoint protection software for dedicated threat detection. The endpoint software detects intrusions, malware, and malicious activities on endpoints and assists in rapid response to eliminate and mitigate the threats.

## Network security

* **Firewall:** Notion office networks are configured with a network firewall. WAN-accessible network services are not to be hosted within the office environment.

* **IDS/IPS:** Notion utilizes a mix of both network and host-based IDS/IPS type systems part of a broader defense-in-depth approach to securing the organization. This includes monitoring for suspicious activity through a combination of signature-based and anomaly-based detections.

* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):&#x20;**&#x4E;otion utilizes a SIEM solution for incident and event management. Event notifications are communicated to our security staff in real-time.

* **Wireless Security:&#x20;**&#x4E;otion offices use strong encryption for office wireless networks. Notion does not maintain any wireless networks with impacts on customer data or production systems.

For information around how long Notion will maintain data, please refer to the [Data Processing Addendum](https://www.notion.com/notion/Data-Processing-Addendum-361b540101274b1fa7e16b90402b0d99).

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.notion.com/help/delete-your-account) to delete your data.


### If there was a disaster with Notions Systems and my Notion Instance was impacted, how does Notion restore itself? 

Notion performs daily automated backups of all customer and system data to protect against loss due to unforeseen events across separate availability zones in AWS US West-2 and <!-- -->AWS US East-2.

WeÂ have a dedicated Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan for these circumstances, and our Disaster Recovery Plan is tested at least annually to ensure Notion will recover from a disruption resulting from a disaster.


### Can Notion employees access our information? 

Notion employees will only ever access your data for the purposes of troubleshooting problems or recovering content on your behalf. Please refer to our [Data Access Consent](https://www.notion.com/help/data-access-consent) for further information.


### Will other people be able to see my pages?

Your data is safe in Notion! If someone tries to navigate to your workspace without having access, theyâ€™ll see a page that lets them know that they do not have the correct permission state to access that content.

If you enableÂ `Share to web`Â in theÂ `Share`Â menu at the top right of a page, it will publish that page to the web so that anyone with the link can access it. This is always turned off by default.

If youâ€™re sharing a workspace with others, some pages will be visible to everyone in the workspace, or specific groups of people â€” this is based on the permissions you see in theÂ `Share`Â menu at the top right of the page.

Please note, if you are using an account in an enterprise workspace, your content may be accessed by the workspaceâ€™s workspace owner. Learn more in [our Personal Use Terms of Service](https://notion.notion.site/Personal-Use-Terms-of-Service-00e4e5d0f2b9411cbee6493f15779500).


### Can I opt out of Notion's tracking/analytics?

Yes you can! This will also disable <!-- -->in-app message support<!-- -->, but you can still reach out to us for help atÂ email protected.

Just send a message to our support team at that address and we'll opt you out.


### My browser alerted me that Notion is using trackers. What do these trackers do?

We use tracking code in order to effectively run ads (for example, tracking a visit to our marketing site). We isolate this to a sandboxed iframe on a subdomain ([aif.notion.so](http://aif.notion.so/)) â€” it's never activated on user pages.

No user content is exposed to any third-party service.


### Does Notion review findings from Third Party Risk Assessment Platforms (i.e. Security Scorecard, Bitsight, Upguard)? 

We understand that many organizations use third-party risk assessment platforms for security due diligence. However, weâ€™ve noticed that these platforms often produce unreliable and incorrect results, and addressing these incorrect findings is costly and distracts from important cybersecurity work. Therefore, our policy is to not always respond to inquiries or findings from these platforms. This approach allows us to focus our cybersecurity resources on what truly matters for Notion and our customers.
