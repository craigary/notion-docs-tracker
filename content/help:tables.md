## Create a table view

Here's how to to add a database in table view to Notion:

1. Create a new page in your workspace.

2. Under `Get started with`, <!-- -->click `â€¢â€¢â€¢` â†’ `Table`.

If you want to create an inline table, typeÂ `/Table view` on any pageÂ and press `enter`.

**Note:**Â Expand inline databases to full page by clickingÂ `â¤¢`Â at the top right.

### Add table view to a database

You can add a table to an existing database to view its data in that format.Â 

1. Click `+` next to the name of your database or the name of your current database view.

2. SelectÂ `Table`Â from the dropdown menu.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x59;ou can also create simple tables if you want to display plain text visually without database functionalities (such as filters, sorts, and specific property values).

## Bulk edit multiple rows

You can select multiple rows in order to edit their properties.

1. Hover over any row and click the checkbox that appears next to it.

   * If you want to select all of the rows in your database, hover over the `Name` property and click the checkbox that appears next to it.

2. From the menu that appears, edit any of your database properties for your selected rows.

## Customize your table

### Rearrange columns and rows

Switch up how your table is ordered with drag-and-drop on desktop or browser.

* For rows, hover, then click and hold theÂ `â‹®â‹®` icon on the left to drag it up or down.

* For columns, click and hold their headings to drag them left or right (like below).

  * Resize columns by hovering over their edges, and dragging right or left.

**Tip:**Â You can also rearrange your columns by clickingÂ `Properties`Â at the top right, then using theÂ **`â‹®â‹®`**Â icon next to the properties shown to drag them up or down.

### Wrap cell content

If your cells contain a lot of content, you can wrap the content to make it appear across multiple lines. To do this, click the name of a database property. In the menu that appears, select `Wrap text`.

### Calculations

For each column in your database, you can run calculations that will show you information about the data contained in that column.

Depending on the type of property youâ€™re running a calculation on, youâ€™ll see some or all of the following calculation options:

* `Count all`: Gives you the total number of rows in the column.

* `Count values`: Counts the number of property values contained in the column.Â 

* `Count unique values`: Counts the number of unique property values contained in the column, omitting duplicates.Â 

* `Count empty`: Counts the number of rows that do not have a value in the column.Â 

* `Count not empty`: Counts the number of rows where the column is filled.Â 

* `Percent empty`: Gives you the percentage of rows that do not have the chosen property filled in.Â 

* `Percent not empty`: Gives you the percentage of cards that do have the property filled in.Â 

* `Earliest date`: If you have time-related properties in your table likeÂ `Last edited`Â orÂ `Created time`, you can choose to show when the oldest row was edited or created.

* `Latest date`: Shows when the newest row was last edited or created.

* `Date range`: Shows you the time gap between the oldest and newest edit or creation time.

* If you have aÂ `Number`Â property in your table, you unlock several other calculation options:

  * `Sum`: Shows the sum of the numbers in the column.

  * `Average`: Shows the average of the numbers in the column.

  * `Median`: Shows the median of the numbers in the column.

  * `Min`: Shows the lowest number in the column.

  * `Max`: Shows the highest number in the column.

  * `Range`: Subtracts the lowest number from the highest.

To run a calculation on a property:

1. Click on a property in your table.

2. In the menu that appears, hover over `Calculate`. Select from one of the calculation options.

## FAQs

### Is there a way to add background colors to specific cells? Or conditional formatting?

Not at the moment, unfortunately. It's a popular feature request though, so definitely on our radar! For the time being, you can useÂ SelectÂ andÂ Multi-selectÂ properties to add a pop of color to your tableÂ ðŸŽ¨


### Why can't I delete the Name property?

Our tables are a lot different than traditional spreadsheets, since each row represents a database entry that can be opened as its own page, or visualized in other database views. TheÂ `Title`Â property gives you access to database pages. That said, you can drag the column left or right to re-order it however you want!


### I donâ€™t want my database pages to open on the side or in the center of my page. Is there anyway to open a database page in full-screen by default?

Yes! To do this:

1. Open the settings menu at the top of your database.

2. Select `Layout` â†’ `Open pages in` â†’ `Full page`.


### Does Notion have simple (non-database) tables?

Yes! [Learn more about simple tables here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/columns-headings-and-dividers#simple-tables)


### How can I turn a full-page database into an inline database, or vice versa?

To change a full-page database into an inline database:

1. Drag the full-page database from your sidebar into another page. It will become a sub-page of that page.

2. Open the parent page, click the **`â‹®â‹®`** button next to the database sub-page, and select `Turn into inline`.

To change an inline database to a full-page database, drag an inline database block into your sidebar as a top-level page.
