## Create a table view

Here's how to to add a database in table view to Notion:

1. Create a new page in your workspace.

2. Under `Get started with`, <!-- -->click `•••` → `Table`.

If you want to create an inline table, type `/Table view` on any page and press `enter`.

**Note:** Expand inline databases to full page by clicking `⤢` at the top right.

### Add table view to a database

You can add a table to an existing database to view its data in that format. 

1. Click `+` next to the name of your database or the name of your current database view.

2. Select `Table` from the dropdown menu.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x59;ou can also create simple tables if you want to display plain text visually without database functionalities (such as filters, sorts, and specific property values).

## Bulk edit multiple rows

You can select multiple rows in order to edit their properties.

1. Hover over any row and click the checkbox that appears next to it.

   * If you want to select all of the rows in your database, hover over the `Name` property and click the checkbox that appears next to it.

2. From the menu that appears, edit any of your database properties for your selected rows.

## Customize your table

### Rearrange columns and rows

Switch up how your table is ordered with drag-and-drop on desktop or browser.

* For rows, hover, then click and hold the `⋮⋮` icon on the left to drag it up or down.

* For columns, click and hold their headings to drag them left or right (like below).

  * Resize columns by hovering over their edges, and dragging right or left.

**Tip:** You can also rearrange your columns by clicking `Properties` at the top right, then using the **`⋮⋮`** icon next to the properties shown to drag them up or down.

### Wrap cell content

If your cells contain a lot of content, you can wrap the content to make it appear across multiple lines. To do this, click the name of a database property. In the menu that appears, select `Wrap text`.

### Calculations

For each column in your database, you can run calculations that will show you information about the data contained in that column.

Depending on the type of property you’re running a calculation on, you’ll see some or all of the following calculation options:

* `Count all`: Gives you the total number of rows in the column.

* `Count values`: Counts the number of property values contained in the column. 

* `Count unique values`: Counts the number of unique property values contained in the column, omitting duplicates. 

* `Count empty`: Counts the number of rows that do not have a value in the column. 

* `Count not empty`: Counts the number of rows where the column is filled. 

* `Percent empty`: Gives you the percentage of rows that do not have the chosen property filled in. 

* `Percent not empty`: Gives you the percentage of cards that do have the property filled in. 

* `Earliest date`: If you have time-related properties in your table like `Last edited` or `Created time`, you can choose to show when the oldest row was edited or created.

* `Latest date`: Shows when the newest row was last edited or created.

* `Date range`: Shows you the time gap between the oldest and newest edit or creation time.

* If you have a `Number` property in your table, you unlock several other calculation options:

  * `Sum`: Shows the sum of the numbers in the column.

  * `Average`: Shows the average of the numbers in the column.

  * `Median`: Shows the median of the numbers in the column.

  * `Min`: Shows the lowest number in the column.

  * `Max`: Shows the highest number in the column.

  * `Range`: Subtracts the lowest number from the highest.

To run a calculation on a property:

1. Click on a property in your table.

2. In the menu that appears, hover over `Calculate`. Select from one of the calculation options.

## FAQs

### Is there a way to add background colors to specific cells? Or conditional formatting?

Yes! Learn more about conditional color [here →](https://www.notion.com/help/database-properties#conditional-color)


### Why can't I delete the Name property?

Our tables are a lot different than traditional spreadsheets, since each row represents a database entry that can be opened as its own page, or visualized in other database views. The `Title` property gives you access to database pages. That said, you can drag the column left or right to re-order it however you want!


### I don’t want my database pages to open on the side or in the center of my page. Is there anyway to open a database page in full-screen by default?

Yes! To do this:

1. Open the settings menu at the top of your database.

2. Select `Layout` → `Open pages in` → `Full page`.


### Does Notion have simple (non-database) tables?

Yes! [Learn more about simple tables here →](https://www.notion.com/help/columns-headings-and-dividers#simple-tables)


### How can I turn a full-page database into an inline database, or vice versa?

To change a full-page database into an inline database:

1. Drag the full-page database from your sidebar into another page. It will become a sub-page of that page.

2. Open the parent page, click the **`⋮⋮`** button next to the database sub-page, and select `Turn into inline`.

To change an inline database to a full-page database, drag an inline database block into your sidebar as a top-level page.
