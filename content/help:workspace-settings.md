**Note:** Many of these settings are only visible if you're an admin on a Plus Plan or Enterprise Plan. They don't appear in the mobile app at all. [Contact sales to learn more about our Enterprise plan →](https://notionup.typeform.com/to/FbZ6Tk)

## Change your workspace name and icon

To change your workspace name and icon:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Under `Workspace`, select `General`.

3. In the field under `Name`, enter a simple name for your workspace.

4. Under `Icon`, click on your current icon and choose an emoji or upload your own image.

## Allowed email domains

Make it simple for people with certain email address domains to automatically join your workspace as members, or as workspace owners if you're on a Free Plan. As soon as they sign up, Notion will recognize their email and ask if they want to join your workspace.

To set an allowed domain:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Under `Workspace`, select `General`.

3. Under `Trusted domain access`, find the field under `Allowed email domains` and enter your domain.

**Note:**

* New allowed domains are restricted to the email domains of the members of that workspace. To add a domain that isn't available, someone with an email address from that domain will have to join the workspace.

* Bear in mind that you'll be charged per member on Plus, Business, and Enterprise Plans.

## Export your entire workspace

**Note:&#x20;**&#x54;o verify a domain for your organization, you must be an [organization owner](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls).

Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.

If you're on a Business or Enterprise Plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.

Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.

A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.

To export your workspace content:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Under `Workspace`, select `General`.

3. Find and select `Export all workspace content`.

4. You'll receive an email from Notion with a link to download your files. This link will expire after 7 days.

**Note:**

* You can only export your entire workspace on desktop or web.

* You can’t instantly recreate your workspace by reuploading your exported workspace content.

## Export workspace members

If you have a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan, you can export a list of everyone in your workspace.

The exported CSV will include:

* Email.

* First name.

* Last name.

* Role (Workspace owner, membership admin, member, or guest).

* A list of permission groups that each member is part of.

* User ID.

To export workspace members as a CSV:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Under `Workspace`, select `General`.

3. Find and select `Export members as CSV`.

## Analytics

If you want page view analytics to be visible for users who have full access or edit access to a page:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Under `Workspace`, select `General`.

3. Toggle on `Save and display page view analytics`.

## Delete your workspace

Once a workspace is deleted:

* This action is permanent.

* All of the content inside of it will be deleted. You won’t be able to access your content — even your private pages. You might want to [export](https://www.notion.com/help/export-your-content) any data that you want to keep after you delete the workspace.

* The deleted workspace will be deleted for everyone in it. This means all users who were part of a workspace before it was deleted will no longer have access to that workspace or any content inside that workspace.

* You'll be returned to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any others.

To delete a workspace:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Under `Workspace`, select `General`.

3. Scroll down to `Danger zone` and select `Delete entire workspace`. You'll be asked to type the name of your workspace to confirm you want to proceed.

## Emoji

Custom emojis can be used as page icons, in reactions, and inline. Workspace members can go to `Settings` in their sidebar → `Emoji` to manage custom emojis in their workspace. From here, they can:

* Select `Add emoji` to upload their own file.

* Select `•••` next to a custom emoji they’ve added, and `Edit` or `Delete` it.

* Workspace owners can edit or delete any emoji, even if they didn’t create it.

* Workspace owners can also toggle on `Limit custom emoji creation to workspace owners` if they don’t want all members to create custom emojis.

## Workspace security

Depending on how you're using your workspace, you may want to keep the data you have in it private for just your team. You can go to the `Security` section to adjust your workspace security settings.

**Note:** Some of the following settings are available on specific Notion plans only.

* `Allow page access requests from non-members`: This setting is available to all plans except Enterprise.

* `Allow members to request adding other members`: This setting is available to users on the Plus Plan or higher.

* `Allow any user to request to be added as a member of the workspace`: This setting is available to users on the Plus Plan or higher.

* `Allow page guests to request to be added as members to the workspace`: This setting is available to users on the Plus Plan or higher.

### Security settings available on Enterprise Plans only

* `Disable publishing sites and forms`: Don't let members publish [Notion Sites](https://www.notion.com/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing) or [forms](https://www.notion.com/help/forms) to the web. Any Sites or forms already live on the web will be taken down.

* `Disable duplicating pages to other workspaces`: Don't let members move pages to other workspaces. Especially helpful if you have a lot of people and a lot of pages. It can get confusing fast, and some people may lose access when pages get moved.

* `Disable export`: Don't let members export pages. This ensures that all your data stays in Notion rather than having different versions saved as Markdown or CSV.

* `Allow members to invite guests to pages`: Let members invite guests to specific workspace pages.

* `Allow members to request adding guests`: Let members ask to invite guests to workspace pages.

* `Who can add restricted members to Teamspaces`: Choose whether workspace owners, workspace and teamspace owners, or any member can add restricted members to a teamspace.

* `Who can add restricted members to pages`: Choose whether workspace owners, any member with admin approval, or any member can add restricted members to a page.

* `Once pages are moved to Trash, delete them after`: This allows you to choose how long pages will be deleted after being moved to Trash.

* `After pages are deleted from Trash, retain them for`: This allows you to choose how long pages can be retained after being deleted from Trash.

## Verify a domain

If you're on the Business or Enterprise Plan, you can verify a domain for your workspace.

**Note:** If you're on the Enterprise Plan, you'll need to [verify your domain via your organizational level controls](https://www.notion.com/help/domain-management#verify-a-domain-for-your-organization).

To verify a domain for your workspace:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Select `Identity`.

3. Next to `Verified domains`, select `Add domain`.

4. Enter your new domain and select `Next`.

5. Follow the prompts to update your DNS record.

6. Click `Verify` to prompt Notion to check your DNS record.

   * If your domain’s status is `Pending`, select `•••`**&#x20;**&#x6E;ext to the domain → `View details` → `Verify` to manually verify it.

7. Once verification is complete, you’ll receive a confirmation email and your domain’s status will be `Verified`.

## Enable SAML SSO

If you're on the Business or Enterprise Plan, you can set up SAML SSO for your workspace. Learn more in [this article →](https://www.notion.com/help/saml-sso-configuration#set-up-saml-sso-for-a-workspace)


## FAQs

### I'm on a Plus Plan, but don't see any of these settings in Settings.

Only Workspace owners can access these workspace settings. If you navigate to the Members tab, you'll see whether you're a guest, member, Membership admin, or Workspace owner in the workspace. Ask a Workspace owner to upgrade your membership status if necessary.


### I'm trying to add a new domain to the Allowed Email Domains setting, but it won't let me.

New allowed domains are restricted to the email domains of the members of that workspace. To add a domain that isn't available, someone with an email address from that domain will have to join the workspace.


### Does Notion support custom domains?

### How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?

**Note:&#x20;**&#x41;ny migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information, [click here](https://www.notion.com/help/transfer-content-to-another-account).

To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click `•••` next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and select `Move to`. <!-- -->At the bottom of the move menu, you’ll see a drop down to select a different workspace.

When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in the `Private` section but can be moved wherever you want to put them.
