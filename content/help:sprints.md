Task databases and sprints help your team easily manage time-boxed work and stick to a schedule.

## Create a task database

A task database in Notion is a type of database that requires a status, assignee, and due date property to help you track the work that you need to get done.

To create a task database or turn an existing database into a task database:

1. Open the settings menu at the top of your database.

   ![hc: db settings icon](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/8Oc0IxM1zM5a9prvSOKNt/c07afa142404beaf680fb079ee9bc085/Reference_Visuals_Group_159.png)

2. Under `Database settings`, select `More settings`.

3. In the menu that appears, select `Turn into Tasks`.

4. Pick which properties in your database will correspond with the task status, assignee, and due date. If your database doesnâ€™t already have these properties, you can create them by selecting `Create new`.

5. Select `Turn into task database`.

Any tasks assigned to you from that database will appear in My tasks. My tasks is a widget inside Home that helps you track your tasks across all task databases in your workspace in one place. Learn more [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/home-and-my-tasks)

## Turn a task database into a regular database

If you no longer want a database to be a task database:

1. Open the settings menu at the top of your database.

2. Under `Database settings`, select `More settings`.

3. In the menu that appears, select `Undo Task database`.

## Give your task an ID

ID is a database property that helps you manage projects and organize tasks. Once the property is added, a unique ID will automatically be assigned to every existing database item and every future database item you create.

To add the ID property to your database:

1. Click the `+` at the far right side of the database to add a new property.

2. Select `ID`.

3. To add an optional prefix to your IDs, select `Add ID prefix`. The prefix will be generated automatically, but you can change it anytime by entering your desired prefix in the text box and selecting `Update ID Prefix`.

### ID URLs

All pages with the ID property can be accessed via a special URL with the ID number. For example, if a page has the ID: `TASK-123` you can get to that page at `notion.so/TASK-123`.

**Unique ID URLs will only work if your unique ID has a prefix.&#x20;**&#x54;o make sure your unique IDs contain a prefix, click on the ID property in your database, select `Edit property`, and check that the `Prefix` field is not empty.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x55;nique ID numbers always start at 1 and are assigned to every page, including deleted pages. ID numbers will never change.

## Create a sprint

To use Sprints, you must have a Task database in Notion. You can turn any database in Notion into a Task database following [these instructions](https://www.notion.com/help/sprints#create-a-task-database).

Turn task trackers into Task databases so all your tasks appear in Home.

Once you have a Task database, you can add Sprints to your set-up. To do this:

1. Open the settings menu at the top of your database.

2. Under `Database settings`, select `More settings`.

3. In the menu that appears, select `Sprints`.

4. Select `Turn on sprints`.

### Sprint board and sprints database

Once you turn on sprints for your database, a few items will be created to help you track them. **These will be accessible in your Notion sidebar, alongside the original database you used to set up sprints.**

The `Sprint board` is where you can track all of the tasks belonging to your current and future sprints, using a few different views:

* `Current Sprint`: Shows tasks in the current sprint.

* `Sprint planning`: Shows tasks in the current, next, and last sprint, as well as any tasks not yet assigned to a sprint.

* `Backlog`: Shows tasks not assigned to a sprint.

[](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/5jFdrcA0OTX0Ka9JPwGuQF/cf249081e50c0d4e48516f502444e1b1/sprint_board.mp4)

The `Sprints` database will give you a general view of your current and future sprints. You can open any sprint's page to view the tasks within. You'll also notice a `Timeline` view, which gives you a more linear look at your sprints.

If youâ€™ve accidentally deleted the `Current Sprint` view and want to recreate it:

1. Set up a view in the original task database that youâ€™d like to use as your `Current Sprint` view.

2. Select the settings menu at the top right â†’ `More settings` â†’ `Sprints` â†’ `Manage sprint from this view`.

## Plan a sprint

1. In the `Sprint board`, go to the `Sprint planning` view.

2. Move any unfinished tasks from your current sprint or from the backlog into the next sprint.

## Complete a sprint

To mark a sprint as complete:

1. In the `Sprint board`, go to your `Current` sprint.

2. Select `Complete sprint`.

3. You'll be asked to confirm the dates of your next sprint and what you'd like to do with the incomplete tasks from your current sprint. You can move them to the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in the current sprint.

4. Select `Complete Sprint`.

Alternatively, you can seamlessly transition from one sprint to the next by setting sprints to automatically complete. [Learn about how to set your sprints to automatically complete and begin below â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/sprints#sprint-settings)

When you complete a sprint:

* The status of your `Current` sprint will be changed to `Last`. Whichever sprint was currently assigned to `Last`, if there is one, will now be set to `Past`.

* The status of the `Next` sprint will be changed to `Current`.

* The tasks on the board will reflect the new `Current` sprint.

* The `Next` sprint will be created if none exists.

## Sprint settings

Customize your sprints to fit your needs. To do this, go to your sprint board and select the settings menu at the top â†’ `More settings` â†’ `Sprints`.

* `Duration`: Choose how many weeks (from one to eight) you want each sprint to run for.

* `Start on`: Choose which day of the week you want your sprints to begin on. If you change this in the middle of an active sprint, the current sprintâ€™s dates will change. For example, if your sprints used to run for two weeks starting on Mondays, but you want your sprints to run for two weeks starting on Thursdays, your current sprint will run until two weeks after the upcoming Thursday, so that your next sprint can begin on Thursday as you indicated.

* `Incomplete tasks`: Choose what will happen to any incomplete tasks from your sprints. You can put them in the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in their original sprint.

* `Automated sprints`: Turn this on if you want sprints to complete automatically before the next one is automatically created and started.

* `Turn off sprints`: Choose this to turn off a sprint. Once you turn sprints off, your sprints database, sprint board, and relations between tasks and sprints will be permanently deleted. If you choose to turn sprints on again, youâ€™ll start with a brand new database, board, and relations.

**Note:**

* You canâ€™t adjust the dates in your sprints database because these dates are either populated based on the settings above, or set when you manually complete a sprint.

* If you need to break your sprint cadence temporarily, like for the holidays, we suggest turning off automatic sprints and waiting until youâ€™re ready to resume your normal sprint cadence before starting your next sprint.
