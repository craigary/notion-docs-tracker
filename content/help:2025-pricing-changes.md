## At a glance

### What's changing?

Starting May 13, 2025, Notion is making some changes to our pricing and packaging, including the following:

* Notion AI is included in Business and Enterprise Plans. Itâ€™s no longer available as an add-on to any new users on the Free or Plus Plan.

* Certain Notion features are now available only on Business and Enterprise Plans.

* Pricing for Business and Enterprise Plans is changing â€” see our updated pricing grid [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/pricing)

### When do these changes go into effect?

For new customers, all changes go into effect on May 13, 2025.

For existing customers:

* If youâ€™re on **monthly** billing, the new pricing will go into effect at your first plan renewal on or after August 13, 2025.

* If youâ€™re on **annual** billing and are **not subscribed to Notion AI**, the new pricing will go into effect at your first plan renewal on or after August 13, 2025. Go to `Settings` â†’ `Billing` to see when your plan renews.

* If youâ€™re on **annual** billing and are **subscribed to Notion AI**, the new pricing will go into effect on August 13, 2025. The difference between your old and new pricing will be issued to you in the form of credits on August 13, 2025.

* After August 13, 2025, any Notion features affected by these changes will no longer be available unless you upgrade to the appropriate plan.

* If you're currently subscribed to the Notion AI add-on, youâ€™ll continue to have access to your existing Notion AI features even after these changes are in effect, as long as you remain subscribed.

### What do I need to do now?

If youâ€™re an existing Notion user:

* Review our new [pricing page](https://www.notion.com/pricing) to see how our plans and features are changing.

* If youâ€™d like to stay on your current plan, you donâ€™t need to take any action. Any adjustments to your pricing will be made on or after August 13, 2025, depending on your plan and billing cadence.

  * Youâ€™ll have until August 13, 2025 to access, edit, and export any content related to features that you may be losing access to as a result of these changes (connected properties, synced databases, and more). You can see more information on which features are being affected and how [below â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/2025-pricing-changes#feature-availability)

* If you want to upgrade your plan to retain specific features that you may be losing access to or to access more Notion features, youâ€™ll have until August 13, 2025 to upgrade without losing any features and associated data.

## Notion AI and pricing changes

If you werenâ€™t subscribed to [Notion AI](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs) before May 13, 2025, Notion AI will no longer be an add-on to plans, but instead will be available by default with a Business or Enterprise Plan subscription. Youâ€™ll need to be on a Business or Enterprise Plan to use of all of Notion AIâ€™s features.

Business and Enterprise Plan prices are increasing as a result of additional features being offered on those plans, including Notion AI and more advanced functionality for organizations. You can see updated pricing for our various plans [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/pricing)

If youâ€™re already subscribed to Notion AI, donâ€™t worry! As long as you remain subscribed, youâ€™ll have continued access to the following Notion AI features:

* Chatting with Notion AI

* Writing assistance

* Notion AI-powered blocks

* Translation

* Autofill in databases

* Notion AI in Notion Mail

Note that if you remove Notion AI from your current plan, youâ€™ll need to upgrade to the Business or Enterprise Plan to regain access to Notion AI features.

If youâ€™re on a Business or Enterprise Plan, youâ€™ll be able to use of all the above Notion AI features you already know and love, plus some new advanced features including:

* Enterprise Search

* AI Meeting Notes

* Research Mode

Users who are on a Free or Plus Plan and want to access these additional Notion AI features can upgrade to the Business or Enterprise Plan.

Hereâ€™s how these changes might impact your access to Notion AI as well as your pricing based on your plan. Any changes in pricing will go into effect for your plan at the start of your next billing cycle on or after August 13, 2025. If youâ€™re on an annual billing cycle and going to be experiencing a price decrease as a result of these pricing changes, the difference between your old and new pricing will be issued to you in the form of credits on August 13, 2025.

## FAQs

### I donâ€™t want Notion AI for my plan. Can I remove it and get my pricing reduced?

If youâ€™re on a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan, these plans will come with Notion AI. Though you can turn Notion AI off for your workspace, we canâ€™t reduce pricing for users who have turned Notion AI off.

If youâ€™re on a Free or Plus Plan, you can continue to use your plan without the Notion AI add-on.


### Iâ€™m on a Free or Plus Plan with a Notion AI add-on. Whatâ€™s happening to my workspace on May 13, 2025?

If you're on the Free or Plus Plan and you have the Notion AI add-on, you'll continue to have access to Notion AI **as long as you remain subscribed**. Removing the Notion AI add-on will require you to subscribe to the Business or Enterprise Plan to regain access to Notion AI features.


### I'm on a Plus Plan with a Notion AI add-on. What happens to my payments toward my plan and Notion AI when I upgrade to Business?

When you upgrade to the Business Plan, your annual Plus Plan payment, as well as your Notion AI add-on payments, will go toward the upgrade.


### Iâ€™m on a Business or Enterprise Plan with a Notion AI add-on. Whatâ€™s happening to my workspace on May 13, 2025?

Business and Enterprise Plan users who are paying for the Notion AI add-on will continue to access all of Notion AIâ€™s features on May 13, 2025. Theyâ€™ll be moved to updated pricing (where Notion AI is no longer an add-on to their plan, but included in their plan) on or after August 13, 2025, depending on their plan and billing cadence.


### I donâ€™t want to lose access to any of the features I currently have. What should I do?

You can access, edit, and [export](https://www.notion.com/help/export-your-content) existing data until August 13, 2025.

Depending on the features you want to continue enjoying, consider upgrading to another plan. You can refer to our [pricing page](https://www.notion.com/pricing) to see what features come with each plan to find the best fit for you.


### Will you be making any changes to guest limits?

If your plan stays the same, nothing will happen to the guests in your workspace. If you downgrade your plan, your workspace may be subject to a lower guest limit.


### Why are you changing your prices?

Weâ€™re enhancing our plans to better align with our customersâ€™ evolving needs by providing more product offerings, including powerful Notion AI features, for larger teams. Our pricing changes reflect these additional capabilities and the value they bring to help make your organization more productive and secure.


### Iâ€™m in the middle of a free trial or special offer with Notion. How do these changes impact that?

If youâ€™re a startup and you started a trial of our Plus Plan with Notion AI before May 13, 2025, you'll be moved to a Business Plan trial instead to try out Notion's more advanced features for teams for the remaining duration of your original trial.

If youâ€™re a startup and you want to start a trial on or after May 13, 2025, youâ€™ll be able to trial our Business Plan.

Learn more about our Business Plan trials [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/paid-plan-trials)


### I want to change to a different plan.

If youâ€™d like to upgrade your plan, you can go to `Settings`Â â†’Â `Upgrade plan`Â orÂ `Explore plans`Â (depending on your plan), then select `Upgrade` under the plan you want to move to.\
\
If youâ€™d like to downgrade your plan, you can go to `Settings`Â â†’Â `Billing`Â â†’Â `Change plan`. Select the plan you want to change to, then select `Continue` â†’ `Downgrade`. The downgrade will take effect at the end of your billing period.


### Iâ€™m on the Plus + AI plan on mobile. How am I impacted?

The mobile-only **Plus + AI (1 member limit)** plan will continue to be available. If youâ€™re on this subscription, youâ€™ll be able to use all of your current Notion AI features, plus Enterprise Search, AI Meeting Notes, and Research Mode.
