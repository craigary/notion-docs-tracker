## What are passkeys?

Passkeys are secure, easy-to-use alternatives to passwords. Instead of remembering your password, you can sign into Notion using the same method you use to unlock your device. Behind the scenes, passkeys use public-key cryptography to create unique security keys that work only with your Notion account.

Passkeys are simpler and more secure than passwords, even with [two-step verification](https://www.notion.com/help/two-step-verification) enabled. Since passkeys are stored on your device and require biometric authentication like Face ID or Touch ID, they provide better protection against phishing attacks than traditional login credentials.

**Note:** In order to use passkeys,**&#x20;**&#x79;ou **canâ€™t** be in an organization that requires [login using an identity provider](https://www.notion.com/help/saml-sso-configuration) such as Okta, Microsoft Azure, or Google Workspace.

## FAQs

### Do I need to set up a passkey to use Notion?

### Can I set up different kinds of passkeys at the same time?

Yes, you can set up up to five passkeys â€” for example, you could have one that uses your browser and one that uses your password manager. You may consider setting up multiple passkeys so you always have a backup.

Yes, you can use passkeys with or without a password.


### What are the costs or fees associated with passkeys?

Passkeys are available across all plan types. There are no additional costs or fees to use passkeys with your account.


### What if I lose my phone or verification device that I use for passkeys? How do I log in?

You can simply use another sign in method. You can continue to log in with Google or Apple, or enter your email and use the verification code youâ€™re sent to sign in.


### How do I troubleshoot issues with passkeys?

If you canâ€™t access your passkeys, we advise that you use a different login method and go to your settings to update your login methods. If you continue to have issues, please contact our support team.


### Iâ€™m a workspace owner. Can I enforce passkeys for everyone in my workspace?

Unfortunately, workspace owners canâ€™t enforce this feature for all users in their workspace at this time. Weâ€™d love to hear your feedback â€” if this is something you need for your workspace, please reach out and let us know.
