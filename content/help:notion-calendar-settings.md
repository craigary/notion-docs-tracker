**Note:&#x20;**&#x44;ue to some technical limitations, you can‚Äôt currently categorize Notion Calendar notifications as time-sensitive on your mobile device. We‚Äôre looking to improve this in the future.

## Menu bar settings

**Note:** This feature is available only on Notion Calendar for desktop.

You can add Notion Calendar to your menu bar to see your upcoming events and take quick actions like joining a meeting or emailing an event‚Äôs participants. This allows you to access Notion Calendar even when the app is running in the background.

To ensure your menu bar is always visible on your screen:

* On MacOS: Hold `cmd` and drag the menu bar icon closer to the system clock. You might have to go to Notion Calendar `Settings` ‚Üí `Menu bar` and turn off `Event title` to get the Notion Calendar icon to show up.

* On Windows: Click `^` in your taskbar, then drag the Notion Calendar icon to where you want it in your taskbar.

Open the `Menu bar` tab of your settings to adjust the following:

* **Menu bar calendar:** Turn the menu bar on or off.

* **Include events:** Choose how many days‚Äô worth of events you want the menu bar to show. You can also include or exclude `All-day events`, `Events without participants`, or `Events without conferencing/location`.

* **Preview upcoming event in menu bar:** Choose how much in advance you want the menu bar to tell you about an upcoming event. You can also turn on or turn off the ability for the menu bar to show you an `Event title` or `Event time`.

If you want to hide an entire calendar from the menu bar, right-click the calendar from the left sidebar of Notion Calendar. Then, turn off `Events included in menu bar`. This will also turn off upcoming meeting notifications for this calendar.

## Conferencing settings

## Calendar account settings

You‚Äôll find each of your connected calendar accounts under the `Calendar accounts` section of the settings sidebar. For each connected calendar account, you can:

* Choose a default Notion workspace for that account. This is the workspace you want Notion Calendar to search for event attachments, create AI Meeting Notes in, and more.

* Choose default conferencing for that account. This is the conferencing tool you want to use when you add conferencing links to your events.

* `Disconnect` the account.

You can also select `Add calendar account` in the sidebar to connect another calendar.

## Notion workspace settings

You‚Äôll find each of your connected Notion workspaces under the `Notion workspaces` section of the settings sidebar. For each connected workspace, you can:

* Choose to automatically add AI Meeting Notes to new events.

* `Disconnect` the workspace.

You can also select `Add Notion workspace` in the sidebar to connect another calendar.

## Calendar view settings

* **Change the number of days displayed:** Select `¬±` to the immediate right of the last date displayed in Notion Calendar. From there, select `-` or `+` to adjust how many days you‚Äôre able to see in your calendar at once.

  * If you‚Äôre on mobile, open the left sidebar menu and select `1 day`, `2 days`, or `3 days`.

* **All-day section:** You can collapse or expand the section of your calendar that shows all-day events by clicking on the two arrows in your zone column or pressing `ctrl/‚åò` + `K` > `Collapse all-day section` or `Expand all-day section`.

* **Change interface scale:** On desktop with Notion Calendar open, go to `View` in the top bar of your screen. Hover over `Interface scale` and select `Zoom In`, `Zoom Out`, or `Actual Size`.

* **Resize your grid:** On desktop with Notion Calendar open, go to `View` in the top bar of your screen and select `Zoom Hours In` or `Zoom Hours Out` to adjust your calendar‚Äôs density.

If the keyboard shortcut for `Zoom hours in` isn‚Äôt working on Windows, you can change this in Windows settings. Find the `Input language hot keys` setting and make sure that `Ctrl + Shift` is not selected, so that it can be used for Notion Calendar. You can learn more about reassigning hot keys for your keyboard [here ‚Üí](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-do-i-reassign-hot-keys-for-my-keyboard-703f897c-ad72-db5d-8e64-0928873d712f#:~:text=To%20reassign%20a%20key\&text=Select%20the%20Start%20button%2C%20and,to%20reassign%2C%20select%20a%20command.)
