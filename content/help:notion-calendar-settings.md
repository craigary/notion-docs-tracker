## Settings on mobile

If you‚Äôre using Notion Calendar for mobile, you can go to settings by selecting `‚â°` in the top left corner ‚Üí `‚öôÔ∏è`.

If you‚Äôre using Notion Calendar on desktop or browser, you can go to settings by selecting your profile picture ‚Üí `Settings`.

## Notification settings

### Upcoming meeting notifications

Upcoming meeting notifications remind you about meetings you have as early as five minutes before.

To adjust these notifications, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notifications`. From there, you can decide how early you want to be notified about a meeting, and what sound you want notifications to play.

### Default event reminders

Default event reminders are configurable by calendar. These are tied to your Google Calendar notification settings. To adjust these notifications, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notifications` ‚Üí `Google Calendar Settings`.

### System notifications

You can receive Notion Calendar desktop notifications by allowing them in your device‚Äôs settings.

### Browser notifications

To receive Notion Calendar browser notifications, go to <https://calendar.notion.so/settings/notifications>. If notifications are turned off, go to your browser‚Äôs settings and make sure to allow notifications from <https://calendar.notion.so>.

### iCloud email notifications

If you have one email address connected to both a Google Calendar and an iCloud Calendar, but you want events from iCloud to go to your Google Calendar, you can set up iCloud email notifications following the instructions [here ‚Üí](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/receive-emails-updates-shared-calendars-mm8074582205/icloud)

**Note:&#x20;**&#x44;ue to some technical limitations, you can‚Äôt currently categorize Notion Calendar notifications as time-sensitive on your mobile device. We‚Äôre looking to improve this in the future.

## Menu bar settings

**Note:** This feature is available only on Notion Calendar for desktop.

You can add Notion Calendar to your menu bar to see your upcoming events and take quick actions like joining a meeting or emailing an event‚Äôs participants. This allows you to access Notion Calendar even when the app is running in the background.

To ensure your menu bar is always visible on your screen:

* On MacOS: Hold `cmd` and drag the menu bar icon closer to the system clock. You might have to go to Notion Calendar `Settings` ‚Üí `Menu bar` and turn off `Event title` to get the Notion Calendar icon to show up.

* On Windows: Click `^` in your taskbar, then drag the Notion Calendar icon to where you want it in your taskbar.

### Turn off the menu bar calendar

If you don‚Äôt want to see or use the menu bar, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Menu bar` and turn off `Menu bar calendar`.

### Choose what events you want to see in the menu bar

Choose which calendars you want included in the menu bar by going to `Settings` ‚Üí `Menu bar`.

In the dropdown under `Include events:`, select how many days‚Äô worth of events you want the menu bar to show. You can also include or exclude `All-day events`, `Events without participants`, or `Events without conferencing/location`.

If you want to hide an entire calendar from the menu bar, select the calendar from the left sidebar of Notion Calendar. Then, in the right context panel, turn off `Events included in menu bar`. This will also turn off upcoming meeting notifications for this calendar.

### Choose how you want to see events in the menu bar

You can customize how you want the menu bar to display events. Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Menu bar`. In the dropdown under `Preview upcoming event in menu bar:`, select how much in advance you want the menu bar to tell you about an upcoming event.

You can also turn on or turn off the ability for the menu bar to show you an `Event title` or `Event time`.

## Calendar view settings

### Change the number of days displayed

Select `¬±` to the immediate right of the last date displayed in Notion Calendar. From there, select `-` or `+` to adjust how many days you‚Äôre able to see in your calendar at once.
