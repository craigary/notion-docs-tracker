Workspace analytics is an Enterprise Plan feature that provides a comprehensive overview of how your organization is engaging with content across the workspace.

With insights on adoption, engagement, and search behavior, you'll be able to fine-tune your workspace to better serve the specific needs of your team.

**Note:** Your workspace analytics data is tracked starting on the day that you sign up for the Enterprise plan <!-- -->‚Äî you will not have any analytics from before that day.

## Accessing workspace analytics

To access workspace analytics, click on `Settings` in your sidebar and click `Analytics`.

You‚Äôll find workspace analytics in the ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Settings menu

You‚Äôll see an overview of information regarding content in your workspace, including most active teamspaces, viewers and editors.

Select the `Members`, `Content` or `Search` tabs to get more thorough breakdowns. If you‚Äôre not a workspace owner, you‚Äôll only have access to `Content`.

**Note:** When you export workspace analytics, you'll be able to view data going back 365 days.

Each tab shows you a different combination of analytics about your workspace.

### Member engagement

There‚Äôs also a list of workspace members with their activity. Note that any member who opts out of analytics will appear with a strikeout eye icon.

* Sort by clicking on any of the column titles.

  * You can sort by `Page views`, `Page edits`, and `Last active`.

### Content analysis

In the `Content` tab, you can track how members are engaging with workspace content. By analyzing metrics such as the number of views, number of unique viewers, and last edited date, you can quickly determine which content is most popular or outdated.
