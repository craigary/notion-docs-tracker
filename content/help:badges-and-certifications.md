## What does it mean that the certification exams are proctored?

This means that the exams are supervised to ensure fairness and integrity. During the certification exam, your session will be monitored through your webcam and screen-sharing technology. The proctoring system verifies your identity and watches for potential cheating behaviors, such as looking at other devices or having other people in the room.

Before starting your exam, you'll need to:

* Have a working webcam and microphone.

* Show your ID for verification.

* Close all applications except the browser where you‚Äôll be taking the exam.

* Ensure you're in a quiet, private space without interruptions.

The proctoring ensures that everyone earning a certification has demonstrated their knowledge under the same conditions, maintaining the value and credibility of Notion certifications.

Here‚Äôs an example of what you‚Äôll see while taking the exam. The icon at the bottom left of your screen indicates that the proctoring service is recording the session, and the message at the bottom center indicates that your screen is being shared.

## What happens if I fail an exam?

You‚Äôre allowed two retakes within 90 days from when you purchased your exam. If you fail the two retakes, you‚Äôll need to wait 30 days and purchase the exam again.

## How can I ensure a smooth, hassle‚Äëfree test‚Äëtaking experience?
