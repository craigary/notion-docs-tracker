## FAQs

### Do I need two-step verification?

Two<!-- -->-step verification isn't required, but we highly recommend that you use it as an extra layer of security to protect the contents of your Notion workspace.


### I login to Notion through an identity provider. Do I still need two-step verification?

If you login to Notion through SAML SSO (using an identity provider), we recommend setting up two-step verification directly through that identity provider.


### What if I lose my phone or verification device?

When you first set up two-step verification, you'll receive a set of six backup text codes. You can use these codes to access your account in the event you lose your verification device.

Each backup code can only be used once. Once all the codes have been used, you can generate a new set in your settings.

If you're having trouble, please contact us at email protected.


### I‚Äôm a workspace owner. Can I enforce everyone in my workspace to enable two-step verification?

No, workspace owners can't enforce this feature for all users at this time.
