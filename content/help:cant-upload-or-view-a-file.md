## When this error may occur

When you’re uploading or trying to open an image, video, or audio in Notion, you might get the following errors:

* “This image couldn’t be loaded”

* “This audio format can’t be played on this device”

* “This video format can’t be played on this device”

* “Permission denied”

This might happen for several reasons. For example, if you have lots of images on one page, you might see this error since all of the images are loading at once.

## What you can try to fix the error

To fix this error:

* Put some images inside toggles or removing any images you don’t need.

* Try accessing your Notion page using incognito mode in your web browser. If the file loads, the issue is most likely with your browser. You can update your browser and clear your cache to fix the issue.

* Try reuploading the file.

* Make sure the [file type is supported](https://www.notion.com/help/cant-upload-or-view-a-file#file-types-supported-in-notion). If you’ve embedded a file using an external link, make sure it’s from a supported source.

* You might not have the right permission to view the file, or the permissions may have expired. For example, secure URLs to file uploads in Notion expire after 24 hours. Try downloading the media file to your device and reuploading to Notion to ensure it remains available.

* Check to see if a YouTube video contains copyrighted music, and try playing the embed in your web browser instead of the desktop app. YouTube videos with copyrighted music may not play in the desktop app.
