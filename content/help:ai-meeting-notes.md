## Start AI Meeting Notes

Try AI Meeting Notes for free

Take meetings without missing a beat. Notion's AI Meeting Notes captures, summarizes, and organizes your notes‚Äîso you can stay present and leave with clarity.

[Get started](https://www.notion.com/signup?target=create_meeting_note\\\&feature_intent=meeting_notes)

To start AI Meeting Notes, type `/meet` into any page in the desktop app. If you‚Äôre on a web browser, you‚Äôll be prompted to open the Notion desktop app or download it if you haven‚Äôt already.

Write any agenda items or context under `Notes` before the meeting. When generating the summary, Notion AI will take these notes into consideration.

### Start and stop transcription

To transcribe your meeting:

1. Select `Start transcribing`. By doing this, you‚Äôre confirming that everyone in the meeting has given their consent for the meeting to be transcribed.

2. Once the meeting is over and you want to stop transcribing, select `Stop`. The AI summary will automatically start generating. Note that at least one minute of recorded audio is required to generate a summary.

3. If you‚Äôd like to resume your recording, click the slider icon at the top of the meeting notes block ‚Üí `Resume transcription`.

**Note:** To use AI Meeting Notes, Notion requires access to your system audio and screen recording permissions.

This allows us to transcribe other participants' audio when you're using headphones during virtual meetings.

### Change summary format

AI Meeting Notes can structure notes based on the type of meeting you‚Äôre having, like a sales call, standup, or team meeting. To change the format of your AI Meeting Notes summary:

1. Click the slider icon at the top of the block.

2. Hover over `Format` and select one of the options.

   * Format changes only apply to new recordings or when you resume transcription. To update an existing summary with a new format, click `Retry summary`.

**Tip:** Connect AI Meeting Notes to Notion Calendar so you can start notes with one click directly from your calendar, and connect existing notes to calendar events. Click the slider icon at the top of the AI Meeting Notes block to set it up!

## Consent message

Once the block is selected, you will be reminded to **disclose your use of AI Meeting Notes and obtain consent** from all meeting participants before proceeding.

To help you request consent, you‚Äôll have a few easy options:

* **Text**: Click the slider icon at the top of the AI Meeting Notes block and hover over `Consent`. Edit the consent message as you‚Äôd like, then copy and paste it into the chat of the conferencing app you‚Äôre using.

* **Voice**: Click `üîà` at the bottom of the AI Meeting Notes block before you start transcribing. This will play your consent message to all attendees.

  * You can change the voice by clicking the slider icon at the top of the meeting notes block and selecting different voices for different languages. Notion will automatically use your meeting's language to play the appropriate voice.

* **Say it out loud**: A simple ask works too. For example, you could ask, ‚ÄúAlright if I transcribe this meeting using Notion AI Meeting Notes?‚Äù

**Note:** The consent message plays through your **computer speakers**, not your conferencing mic. Be sure to unmute your speakers and disconnect any headphones so everyone in the room can hear it clearly.

## Connect AI Meeting Notes to Notion Calendar

AI Meeting Notes becomes even more powerful with [Notion Calendar](https://www.notion.com/product/calendar). Effortlessly create, organize, and share meeting notes so you can stay present in meetings and keep your team in sync.

To connect AI Meeting Notes to Notion Calendar for the first time:

1. Click the slider icon at the top of an AI Meeting Notes block ‚Üí `Connect Notion Calendar`.

   * If you don‚Äôt see that option, this means your workspace is already connected to Notion Calendar.

2. In Notion Calendar, click your profile icon and go to `Settings`. From here, you can:

   * Choose where to store meeting notes (we recommend a meetings database).

   * Choose to auto-share meeting notes with event participants.

     * This will only occur with event participants who are also in your Notion workspace.

   * Choose to auto-add meeting notes to new events.

There are a few ways to connect AI Meeting Notes with existing events in Notion Calendar:

* Click the slider icon at the top of an AI Meeting Notes block, hover over `Add calendar event`, and select from an upcoming event.

* In the `Upcoming events` section of Notion `Home`, hover over an event and select the AI Meeting Notes icon. You won‚Äôt see this option for all-day events.

* Select an event in Notion Calendar, click on the `AI Meeting Notes and Docs` field, and add meeting notes.

## Legal considerations for transcribing communications

Below is some general information on the laws and regulations that relate to transcriptions, as well as some best practices to consider when enabling AI Meeting Notes.

**Note**: This is provided for informational purposes only and is **not** legal advice. Consult with your legal counsel to evaluate your specific use case to make sure that you use AI Meeting Notes in a legally compliant manner. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of Notion complies with all applicable laws and regulations. See our [Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.notion.com/Master-Subscription-Agreement-4e1c5dd3e3de45dfa4a8ed60f1a43da0) and [Content and Use Policy](https://www.notion.com/notion/Content-Use-Policy-1b9a773d5583486cb5c1d39a8d777a55) for more information.

### Laws related to transcribing communications

In the United States, certain laws require consent of at least one of the participants before recording or transcribing a call or conversation. Others require you to obtain consent from every participant before recording or transcribing a call.

Outside the United States, such as in the European Union, there are similar laws requiring consent of participants before recording or transcribing a call.

In addition to consent requirements, there may also be laws governing how you use, disclose, and secure your call recordings or transcriptions. These laws may vary depending on where your participants are located, the business sector, and industry standards.

### Some best practices for transcribing communications

**Obtaining consent**

Determining which consent laws apply can be complicated when meeting participants are in multiple states or countries, or if you cannot be sure about the location of one or more participants. **We recommend complying with the strictest consent laws and always obtaining consent from all participants before using AI Meeting Notes to transcribe a meeting**.

**Some other best practices**

* Clearly explain to participants that you will transcribe the call using a third-party provider (e.g., Notion AI Meeting Notes).

* Keep adequate records of how you obtained consent.

* Respect a participant‚Äôs choice not to be transcribed.

* If new participants join a call after transcription has begun, stop and obtain consent from new participants before proceeding.

* Make clear to your users how you plan to use and/or share transcriptions (or any information derived from them).

* Make sure that you only use and share transcriptions in a way that is consistent with what you told your users and all applicable laws.

* Keep transcriptions only for as long as you need.

AI Meeting Notes provides ways to disclose your use of the feature and obtain consent from meeting participants, but note that these are just a few examples of how you might obtain consent.

## How Notion processes and stores captured audio and transcriptions

AI Meeting Notes engages [sub-processors](https://www.notion.com/notion/Notion-s-List-of-Subprocessors-268fa5bcfa0f46b6bc29436b21676734?pvs=4) (OpenAI and Anthropic) to record the meeting, process the audio file into a transcription, and then produce insights, such as a meeting summary, action items, participants in the call, and more. **The audio file is immediately deleted within Notion after audio file processing is complete.**

If you do not want the AI Meeting Notes feature available to your users, administrators may opt-out their workspace at any time via the toggle available in their console.
