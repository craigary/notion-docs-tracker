**Note:** AI Meeting Notes is currently in beta and subject to the beta terms of your agreement.

AI Meeting Notes takes detailed meeting notes for you so you can stay focused on the conversation you're having. Notion AI transcribes your meeting and identifies key points and action items that you can share with your entire team.

## Who can use AI Meeting Notes?

To use AI Meeting Notes:

* You must be on Notion‚Äôs Business or Enterprise Plan.

* If you‚Äôre using Notion‚Äôs desktop app, you must be on version 4.7.0 or higher.

  * If you‚Äôre using a Mac device, you must be using macOS 13 or later.

  * If you‚Äôre using a Windows device, you must be on the latest version.

Try AI Meeting Notes for free

Take meetings without missing a beat. Notion's AI Meeting Notes captures, summarizes, and organizes your notes so you can stay present and leave with clarity.

[Get started](https://www.notion.com/signup?target=create_meeting_note\\\&feature_intent=meeting_notes)

AI Meeting Notes is available on the Notion app and browser. The Notion app provides the best experience, especially for video calls, because it captures all sides of the conversation using your system audio and mic. The browser is best suited for in-person conversations since it can only pick up audio from your microphone.

If you're using this feature on your browser, a few things to note:

* Only mic inputs will be transcribed. System audio won't be captured.

* Audio from conferencing tools (Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc) will not be captured if you are using headphones. If you‚Äôre not using headphones and your device‚Äôs volume isn‚Äôt too low, audio from conferencing tools may be captured.

## Start AI Meeting Notes

To start AI Meeting Notes, type `/meet` into any page in the desktop app. If you‚Äôre on a web browser, you‚Äôll be prompted to open the Notion desktop app or download it if you haven‚Äôt already.

Write any agenda items or context under `Notes` before the meeting. When generating the summary, Notion AI will take these notes into consideration.

**Tip:&#x20;**&#x59;ou can also access AI Meeting Notes directly from the `Upcoming events` tile in [Home](https://www.notion.com/help/home).

![HC: AI Meeting Notes](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/2wIymhTp0123btQpVbApgK/0f53efa6d85cc0f62eec706533f025c1/Random_Image_1__1_.png)

### Start and stop transcription

To transcribe your meeting:

1. Select `Start transcribing`. By doing this, you‚Äôre confirming that everyone in the meeting has given their consent for the meeting to be recorded and transcribed.

2. Once the meeting is over and you want to stop transcribing, select `Stop`. The AI summary will automatically start generating. Note that at least one minute of recorded audio is required to generate a summary.

3. If you‚Äôd like to resume your recording, click the slider icon at the top of the meeting notes block ‚Üí `Resume transcription`.

**Note:** To use AI Meeting Notes, Notion requires access to your system audio and screen recording permissions.

This allows us to transcribe other participants' audio when you're using headphones during virtual meetings.

### Change summary format

AI Meeting Notes can structure notes based on the type of meeting you‚Äôre having, like a sales call, standup, or team meeting. To change the format of your AI Meeting Notes summary:

1. Click the slider icon at the top of the block.

2. Hover over `Format` and select one of the options.

   * Format changes only apply to new recordings or when you resume transcription. To update an existing summary with a new format, click `Retry summary`.

**Tip:** Connect AI Meeting Notes to Notion Calendar so you can start notes with one click directly from your calendar, and connect existing notes to calendar events. Click the slider icon at the top of the AI Meeting Notes block to set it up!

## Consent message

Once the block is selected, you will be reminded to **disclose your use of AI Meeting Notes and obtain consent** from all meeting participants before proceeding.

To help you request consent, you‚Äôll have a few easy options:

* **Text**: Click the slider icon at the top of the AI Meeting Notes block and hover over `Consent`. Edit the consent message as you‚Äôd like, then copy and paste it into the chat of the conferencing app you‚Äôre using.

* **Voice**: Click `üîà` at the bottom of the AI Meeting Notes block before you start transcribing. This will play your consent message to all attendees.

  * You can change the voice by clicking the slider icon at the top of the meeting notes block and selecting different voices for different languages. Notion will automatically use your meeting's language to play the appropriate voice.

* **Say it out loud**: A simple ask works too. For example, you could ask, ‚ÄúAlright if I record and transcribe this meeting using Notion AI Meeting Notes?‚Äù

**Note:** The consent message plays through your **computer speakers**, not your conferencing mic. Be sure to unmute your speakers and disconnect any headphones so everyone in the room can hear it clearly.

## Choose a default database for AI Meeting Notes

Want to store all of your AI Meeting Notes in one database for easy access? To set a default database for your meeting notes:

1. Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notion AI`.

2. Open the dropdown menu next to `Default meetings database`.

3. Find and select the database where you want your AI Meeting Notes to be stored.

The next time you create a new AI Meeting Notes page (from an AI Meeting Notes notification, for example), the page will automatically be created inside your default database.

Make sure each AI Meeting Notes page in your database is shared with the right people so they can access it.

## Troubleshoot common issues

### Notion keeps asking for screen and system audio access

You may be getting a pop-up asking you to grant Notion access to your screen and system audio, even after you‚Äôve already granted access. Sometimes, resetting these permissions can resolve the issue.

**How to fix it**

* In your device‚Äôs settings, revoke screen and system audio access for Notion. Then quit Notion, restart your device, open Notion, and follow the prompts to grant access.

* Make sure you‚Äôre on the latest version of the Notion desktop app. If not, upgrade to the latest version and see if that fixes the issue.

### AI Meeting Notes won‚Äôt launch, or transcription isn‚Äôt working

Depending on which version of your operating system or the Notion app you‚Äôre on, AI Meeting Notes might not work properly and you might get an error telling you the feature couldn't launch.

**How to fix it**

* If you‚Äôre using a Mac device, make sure you‚Äôre using macOS 13 or later.

* If you‚Äôre using a Windows device, make sure you‚Äôre on the latest version.

* Make sure you‚Äôre on the latest version of the Notion app.

* Reload your page or restart the app.

### Can‚Äôt use the slash command (/meet) for AI Meeting Notes

If you‚Äôre not able to see AI Meeting Notes in your slash menu, it‚Äôs possible that AI Meeting Notes has been turned off for your workspace.

**How to fix it**

* **If you‚Äôre a workspace owner**, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notion AI` and toggle on `AI Meeting Notes`.

* **If you‚Äôre not a workspace owner**, reach out to your workspace owner and ask if they can turn on AI Meeting Notes for your workspace.

## Connect AI Meeting Notes to Notion Calendar

AI Meeting Notes becomes even more powerful with [Notion Calendar](https://www.notion.com/product/calendar). Effortlessly create, organize, and share meeting notes so you can stay present in meetings and keep your team in sync.

To connect AI Meeting Notes to Notion Calendar for the first time:

1. Click the slider icon at the top of an AI Meeting Notes block ‚Üí `Connect Notion Calendar`.

   * If you don‚Äôt see that option, this means your workspace is already connected to Notion Calendar.

2. At the top of Notion Calendar, click your profile icon ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí AI Meeting Notes.

   * Choose where to store meeting notes (we recommend a meeting notes database). By default, this will be the `Private` section of your Notion workspace, but you can set it to any destination. Note that this setting is different from the default database that you can designate in **Notion** settings. If you want all your AI Meeting Notes to be stored in the same place, make sure to set the same default meeting notes location in both Notion Calendar and Notion!

   * Choose to auto-share meeting notes with event participants.

     * This will only occur with event participants who are also in your Notion workspace.

   * Choose to auto-add meeting notes to new events.

There are a few ways to connect AI Meeting Notes with existing events in Notion Calendar:

* Click the slider icon at the top of an AI Meeting Notes block, hover over `Add calendar event`, and select from an upcoming event.

* In the `Upcoming events` section of Notion `Home`, hover over an event and select the AI Meeting Notes icon. You won‚Äôt see this option for all-day events.

* Select an event in Notion Calendar, click on the `AI Meeting Notes and Docs` field, and add meeting notes.

## Legal considerations for recording and transcribing communications

Below is some general information on the laws and regulations that relate to transcriptions, as well as some best practices to consider when enabling AI Meeting Notes.

**Note**: This is provided for informational purposes only and is **not** legal advice. Consult with your legal counsel to evaluate your specific use case to make sure that you use AI Meeting Notes in a legally compliant manner. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of Notion complies with all applicable laws and regulations. See our [Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.notion.com/Master-Subscription-Agreement-4e1c5dd3e3de45dfa4a8ed60f1a43da0) and [Content and Use Policy](https://www.notion.com/notion/Content-Use-Policy-1b9a773d5583486cb5c1d39a8d777a55) for more information.

### Laws related to recording and transcribing communications

In the United States, certain laws require consent of at least one of the participants before recording or transcribing a call or conversation. Others require you to obtain consent from every participant before recording or transcribing a call.

Outside the United States, such as in the European Union, there are similar laws requiring consent of participants before recording or transcribing a call.

In addition to consent requirements, there may also be laws governing how you use, disclose, and secure your call recordings or transcriptions. These laws may vary depending on where your participants are located, the business sector, and industry standards.

### Some best practices for recording and transcribing communications

**Obtaining consent**

Determining which consent laws apply can be complicated when meeting participants are in multiple states or countries, or if you cannot be sure about the location of one or more participants. **We recommend complying with the strictest consent laws and always obtaining consent from all participants before using AI Meeting Notes to transcribe a meeting**.

**Some other best practices**

* Clearly explain to participants that you will transcribe the call using a third-party provider (e.g., Notion AI Meeting Notes).

* Keep adequate records of how you obtained consent.

* Respect a participant‚Äôs choice not to be transcribed.

* If new participants join a call after transcription has begun, stop and obtain consent from new participants before proceeding.

* Make clear to your users how you plan to use and/or share recordings and transcriptions (or any information derived from them).

* Make sure that you only use and share recordings and transcriptions in a way that is consistent with what you told your users and all applicable laws.

* Keep recordings and transcriptions only for as long as you need.

AI Meeting Notes provides ways to disclose your use of the feature and obtain consent from meeting participants, which you can learn more about [here](https://www.notion.com/help/ai-meeting-notes#consent-message), but note that these are just a few examples of how you might obtain consent.

## How Notion processes and stores audio and transcriptions

AI Meeting Notes engages [sub-processors](https://www.notion.com/notion/Notion-s-List-of-Subprocessors-268fa5bcfa0f46b6bc29436b21676734?pvs=4&_gl=1*194m45c*_gcl_au*MzQwNzAzMzQ2LjE3NTA4NzAxNTY.*_ga*NDk0ODAwMzMxLjE3NDI5MjQyMTk.*_ga_9ZJ8CB186L*czE3NTc5NTcyNjQkbzI2MCRnMSR0MTc1Nzk1NzU2NSRqNjAkbDAkaDA.) (OpenAI, Anthropic, Fireworks, and Baseten Labs, Inc.) to record the meeting, process the audio file into a transcription, and then produce insights, such as a meeting summary, action items, participants in the call, and more.

If you are a workspace owner and do not want the AI Meeting Notes feature available to members of your workspace, you may opt-out your workspace at any time by going to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notion AI` and toggling off `Workspace availability`.

## Local audio storage

Local copies of recorded meeting audio are available to the user initiating AI Meeting Notes (the ‚Äúrecorder‚Äù). The 10 most recently recorded meeting audio files will be stored on the recorder‚Äôs local device and available to download. Only the recorder has the ability to download a locally saved audio file.

This capability is turned off by default for all plans. If you want local audio storage enabled to your users, you may opt-in your workspace at any time by going to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notion AI` and toggling on `Store audio locally`.

## Delete transcription and audio

### Delete a transcription

A transcription can be deleted in two ways:

* Directly in the AI Meeting Notes block, by clicking the slider icon ‚Üí `Delete transcript`. This will also delete the accompanying locally stored audio from the recorder's device.

* By deleting the parent page where the AI Meeting Notes block sits. Once deleted, the page will follow your workspace‚Äôs [data retention settings](https://www.notion.com/help/duplicate-delete-and-restore-content#what-happens-when-a-page-is-deleted).

Enterprise Plan workspace owners can set an **automatic** deletion schedule for transcriptions by going to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notion AI` and setting a deletion schedule for `Automatic transcript deletion`. Summaries and notes will remain in AI Meeting Notes blocks in your workspace, but all transcriptions will be automatically deleted following the chosen deletion schedule.

### Delete locally stored audio

You can choose to store audio recordings on the recorder‚Äôs local device. The recorder can delete locally stored audio from their local device at any time by clicking the slider icon in the AI Meeting Notes block, hovering over `Audio Recordings`, and selecting `Delete recordings`. This deletes all recordings for the specific AI Meeting Notes block.

If an Enterprise Plan workspace owner has turned on both `Automatic transcript deletion` and `Store audio locally` in their settings, local audio recordings will follow the automatic deletion schedule selected for transcriptions. When a transcription is deleted following the automatic deletion schedule, the associated audio recordings stored on the recorder's local device will also be deleted. If a workspace owner sets transcriptions to be deleted immediately after the AI Meeting Notes summary is generated, then no audio will be stored locally on the recorder's device.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x4F;nce the recorder downloads a locally stored meeting audio file, the audio file is within the recorder's sole control. If the recorder downloads an audio file, deletion of the downloaded audio file is up to the recorder. Similarly, if the recorder chooses to share an audio file with third parties, deletion of the distributed copies of the audio file is up to those third parties.

Notion does not listen to the audio coming from your microphone to provide these notifications. Notion records audio only when using AI Meeting Notes. This behavior can be disabled by going to `Settings` ‚Üí `Notifications` and toggling off `Desktop meeting detection notifications`.
