## What qualifies as a dormant account and/or workspace?

* To use Notion, individuals must register for and maintain a user account. This account may be used across many different workspaces.

* Workspaces are where users create and maintain content within Notion. Workspaces may have just one user (the creator of the workspace) or may have many users creating and collaborating within the workspace.

* Dormant accounts are **free** user accounts in which the user has been inactive for five (5) years. Inactivity is measured as failing to log into the account over that time period and failing to edit or create any content in any workspace for five (5) years.

* Workspaces will be deemed dormant if all the owners of the workspace have a dormant user Account.

## Dormant account deletion process

* When a dormant account is identified, the account may be sent an email notification (if the account does not belong to a guest) stating that the dormant account and any dormant workspace will be terminated and deleted in ninety (90) days unless there is activity in the account prior to that date.

* If the ninety (90) day period lapses without activity in the account, the account and any corresponding workspaces will be terminated and deleted.
