### Answer your questions based on your Notion workspace and third-party apps with Enterprise Search and Research Mode

**Note:**

* When Notion AI looks at information in your workspace to answer a question or take an action, it‚Äôll only reference pages that you have created or been invited to, or pages whose privacy settings are set to `Everyone at {your workspace}`.

* It can take around an hour before new content you‚Äôve created in your workspace is referenced by Notion AI.

Notion AI is powerful because it‚Äôs able to find answers to your questions using a wide variety of information, including:

* Pages in your Notion workspace that you have access to.

* [Your Notion AI Connectors](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-connectors-beta), which connect to apps like Slack or Google Drive.

* Information from the web.

To ask Notion AI a question, simply open it and enter your question. If you want Notion AI to take certain pages or people into account when answering your question, you can even @-mention specific pages, teamspaces, and people in your query. Notion AI can also look closely at databases ‚Äî including database views, relations, and properties.

When Notion AI answers a question using information from your workspace, or a connected app, it'll always cite its sources.

You can also indicate what source you want Notion AI to pull from when answering your question. For example, you might want Notion AI to only look in Slack for updates for your upcoming project. To designate sources for Notion AI's answer to your question:

1. Type your question.

2. Click `All sources` at the bottom of the chat.

3. Toggle your desired sources on.

* Find pages in databases.
