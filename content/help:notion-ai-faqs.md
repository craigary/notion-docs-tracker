**Note:** Notion AI is only available on Business and Enterprise Plans. Users on the Free and Plus Plans get a limited number of [complimentary AI responses](https://www.notion.com/help/complimentary-ai-responses) so they can try Notion AI features out.

Notion AI is your built-in, personalized teammate. No need to switch back and forth between Notion and your other tools â€” Notion AI lives in the same place as your project plans, tasks, and everything else you store in Notion, and it can even search information in your connected apps. It takes on all kinds of tasks, from helping you edit a report to building an entire task database for your team, so you have more time to dedicate to whatâ€™s most important.

At a glance, Notion AI can do the following. Weâ€™ll dive into its features in more detail in this article.

* Takes on entire tasks for you and chats with you via [personal Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs#personal-agent). Your personal Agent can use context from your workspace and connected apps to create and edit pages and databases.

* Searches your workspace and connected apps like Slack and Google Drive via [Enterprise Search](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs#enterprise-search) and Notion AI Connectors.

* Dives deep into specific topics and generate reports via [Research Mode](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs#research-mode).

* Transcribes, summarizes, and pulls insights from meetings via [AI Meeting Notes](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs#ai-meeting-notes-\(beta\)).

* Helps you improve your writing inline on a page, or generate custom outputs in a page via [AI blocks](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs#notion-ai-inline).

* [Translates pages](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs#notion-ai-inline) into other languages.

* Creates [databases](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs#notion-ai-for-databases), auto-populates database properties via Autofill, and writes formulas in databases and automations.

Your personal Agent not only thinks for you â€” it actually does the work for you. It can take on tasks from beginning to end, looking at your workspace and connected apps, then even creating or editing content (pages, databases, charts, and much more) in your workspace on your behalf.

You can personalize your Agentâ€™s appearance and personality and teach it how to work with and for you, so it can be a truly customized teammate built into your workspace.

Notion AI is powerful because itâ€™s able to find answers to your questions using a wide variety of information. This includes pages in your Notion workspace that you have access to; your [Notion AI Connectors](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-connectors-beta), which connect to apps like Slack or Google Drive; and information from the web. You can even switch between the latest AI models.

## Notion AI inline

![hc: notion ai inline](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/GbnQUMXeYCFBeoY53qFrb/8ea67ccd16cadaee7117fcddae1ccf75/Sept_15_Screenshot_from_Personal_Agent__3_.png)

Whether youâ€™re working on a first draft or making edits to existing pages, Notion AI can help. It can even generate content for you based on context from your workspace â€” just @-mention a specific page or person in your query.

You can highlight text in a page or hit `space` in a page and have Notion AI:

* Make edits to the page, like adding a summary or translating the pageâ€™s content.

* Review and edit a particular section of the page by fixing grammar, making content longer or shorter, changing the tone, and more.

* Create new content, like an outline, email draft, or table.

* Brainstorm on a certain topic.

When Notion AI creates or edits content for you, you'll have the option to accept or discard those changes, or have Notion AI try again.

### AI blocks

![hc: ai blocks](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/3axYtnLCPRpjaubr0dvMRc/2e801675e7b282104ce613e69e993f2a/Sept_15_Screenshot_from_Personal_Agent__4_.png)

You can power an entire block with Notion AI. Type `/AI Block` into a page and give Notion AI a prompt for what it should generate. This could be a custom output, a summary of the page youâ€™re in, or key points of the page youâ€™re in.

If you want a custom output, give Notion AI as much information as possible to describe the content it should generate. Use @-mentions to refer to people, pages, and dates. You can also click into the field under `Specified context` to select content from your Notion workspace and any connected apps that Notion AI should primarily use to generate content. Under `Search`, select any additional sources that youâ€™d like Notion AI to consider to generate your content.

Select `Done` â†’ `Generate` on an AI block to generate content based on your selected output. You can continue to use the same AI block over time â€” just click `Generate` to refresh the content! You can also edit your AI block setup by selecting the slider icon inside the block.

### Translate a page

Go to `â€¢â€¢â€¢` at the top of the page â†’ `Translate` and Notion AI will translate the page into your desired language. You can also open a chat with your Agent and select `Translate this page`.

## Notion AI for databases

![hc: notion ai for databases](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/52vFvrIA3svOHvhbT0Gb0W/a4b4bdf0cbcc69a65222cc5aacc2fa00/Sept_15_Screenshot_from_Personal_Agent__5_.png)

Notion AI can help you create databases, complete with views and properties, including relations to other databases. Notion AI can then populate database pages with more context and information, like summaries, keywords, and more. If your database has a formula database property, Notion AI can help write or edit your formulas too.

## Notion AI keyboard shortcut

By default, you can use the keyboard shortcut `shift` + `cmd/ctrl` + `J` to engage Notion AI whenever you need it, even when youâ€™re not working in Notion. To customize this shortcut, go to `Settings` â†’ `Preferences` and enter your desired shortcut next to `Keyboard shortcut for Notion AI`.
