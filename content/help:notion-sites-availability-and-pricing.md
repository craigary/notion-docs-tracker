## Custom domain add-on

Workspace owners on paid plans can [connect their existing custom domains with Notion Sites](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-a-custom-domain-with-notion-sites) by purchasing the custom domain add-on. Notion doesn’t sell custom domains or replace your current domain provider — the add-on allows you to use Notion Sites with a custom domain you already own.

Once a workspace owner on a paid plan connects a custom domain with Sites, they'll be charged an additional $10 per month. **Note that with annual billing, you’ll unlock a discounted rate for the custom domain add-on** of an additional $8 per month.

For each custom domain you want to use with Notion Sites, you’ll have to purchase a separate custom domain add-on. You can do this for up to 25 custom domains.

Billing for the custom domain add-on must match your billing for Notion — if you pay for Notion annually, you’ll also be billed annually for the custom domain. If you pay for Notion monthly, you’ll also be billed monthly for the custom domain.

If you add a custom domain to your existing paid plan, you’ll pay a prorated amount for the remaining time left on your current billing cycle. On your next billing date, the custom domain add-on charge will be added to your regular billing cadence.
