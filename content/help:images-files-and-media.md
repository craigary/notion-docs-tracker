### Caption

To give your media block a caption:

For example, if you’re including an image in a page about teaching, you could say “Teacher talks to student in the classroom” instead of “Two people talk in a room”.

2. Or, hover over and click `•••`. Choose `Comment`. You can type `@` followed by someone's name to mention any of your teammates and call their attention to a question, suggestion or idea you have about the image.

### Delete

To delete a media block:

1. Hover over any image, file, or media and click `•••` at the top right or `⋮⋮` on the left. You can also right click on the block itself.

## FAQs

### Why do I not see alignment controls on my image, file or media block?

The alignment controls are hidden if the block is the same width as content on the page, or if the block is already at its maximum width.


### Are there size limits for images and files?

While you can upload an unlimited number of images and files into Notion, there are limits on the size of each image and file.

If you’re on the Free Plan, you can upload files of up to 5MB each. If you’re on a paid plan, you can upload files of up to 5GB each. If you upload an image and get an error telling you that the image is too large to be displayed, you can try uploading the image as a file.
