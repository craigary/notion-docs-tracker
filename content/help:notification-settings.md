## How notifications work

Here's when you will get a notification:

* Someone @-mentions you or replies to your comment.

  * Or you have notifications set to `All comments` for a page.

* You're added to a `Person` property in a database.

* You set a reminder for yourself to show up at a certain time.

### Types and timing

There are several ways these notifications will reach you:

* You'll see a red badge with the number of notifications waiting for you next to `Inbox` at the top of your sidebar. [Learn more about updates here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/updates-and-notifications)

* **Desktop comments and mentions** show up if you have the app installed and open.

* **Desktop meeting detection** sends a notification prompt to start meeting notes when it detects audio activity and finds a matching event on your calendar.

* **Email notifications** are sent if you don't have Notion open at the time of the notification, or if you have mobile notifications turned off and you haven't seen a notification within five minutes.

  * Unless you have `Always send email notifications` turned on, you'll only receive an email notification if you're **not** active on the app.

  * You can also receive email notifications about whatâ€™s happening in your workspace, like what pages you might want to check out or what pages are trending.

**Note:** If you're actively viewing a page that the notification trigger was created on (i.e. the @-mention or reminder), you won't see any notifications.

## Notification settings

Go to `Settings` â†’ `Notifications` to adjust your settings for:

* Mobile push notifications

* Desktop push notifications and badge icons (if youâ€™re using the desktop app)

* Slack notifications

* Email notifications. You can receive notifications for activity in your workspace, page updates, and workspace digests.

## FAQs

### I'm not receiving any mobile or email notifications, but I have them enabled.

If you have Notion open on a mobile device or computer, you won't receive push or email notifications for reminders â€” you'll only see the badge next to `All Updates`.

If Notion is not open on your mobile device or computer, then you will receive a push or email notification.

To always receive email updates regardless of whether or not you have the app open, you can enable `Always send email notifications` in the `Notifications` section of `Settings`.


### Is there a way for the notifications to make a sound or vibration?

Not at the moment, unfortunately ðŸ˜“ On our to-do list though!


### I donâ€™t want to be notified when I get mentioned in a person property in a database. How can I turn this kind of notification off?

Unfortunately, if you donâ€™t want to be notified when youâ€™re mentioned in a person property, youâ€™ll need to ask someone with edit access to turn off notifications in the [specific person propertyâ€™s settings](https://www.notion.com/help/updates-and-notifications#notifications). Individual users canâ€™t unsubscribe from these notifications.
