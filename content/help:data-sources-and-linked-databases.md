## Choosing a data source

When you make a database, you’ll be given the option to select an existing data source from the workspace or to a create a brand new one.

![Create new database](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/6OYZqMM4Lr2EhfJsbeskdV/5d772226f004377c81987c8cb428f1d7/new_db_entry_point.png)

We suggest selecting an existing data source if you want to use the same properties from another database, or an existing view living elsewhere in your workspace. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.

We suggest creating a new data source if the information you're adding to the database is completely new and doesn’t exist anywhere else in your workspace, or if you want to keep it separate from other data. To create a new database, click `New table`, `New list`, etc. (depending on the type of view you are creating) in the menu that appears.

## Create a linked database

Think of each linked database as a two-way excerpt of the source database. It references the same source data, but has its own views, filters, and sorts.

1. In a page, type `/linked` and press enter.

2. A menu will pop up that allows you to type to search for specific databases in your workspace. You can also scroll to browse.

3. The database you select will show up as a copy of the original, which you can filter, sort, and view differently without changing the original.

## Edit linked databases

* When interacting with a linked database, the views, filters, or sorts you create and delete will not affect the views on the original database.

* However, edits you make to the **actual content** or **properties** of a linked database **will** be reflected in the original.

* You can add as many linked databases as you would like inline on a single page. Filter them for different purposes to create your own dashboard.

## FAQs

### I tried sharing a page with a linked database, but the recipient wasn't able to see it.

Whoever you share this type of page with needs to have access to the original database to be able to see any linked excerpts of that database.


### Can I name my linked database something different from the original database?

Not at the moment. We've had a few users ask about this though, so it's on our to-do list!
