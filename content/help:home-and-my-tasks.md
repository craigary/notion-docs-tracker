## Upcoming events

If you use [Notion Calendar](https://www.notion.com/help/create-a-notion-calendar-account), you can see your schedule, join meetings, and access meeting docs and links using the Upcoming events widget in Home. If you haven’t already used Notion Calendar with Notion, you’re logged out of Notion Calendar, or you’re using the widget in a new or different Notion workspace, you can select `Connect to Notion Calendar` in the widget to set up your calendar.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x49;f you’re using Notion for desktop, you may be prompted to sign into your Notion account on the web to set up the Upcoming events widget.

### Customize your Upcoming events widget

To change what’s displayed in the Upcoming events widget, select `•••` in your Upcoming events widget. From here, you can select:

* `Calendars`: Choose which calendars you want reflected in the widget. You can also have the widget reflect your Notion Calendar app.

* `Include events`: Choose how many days’ worth of events you want displayed. This can span from `Today` (1 day) to `1 week`.

* `All-day events`: Toggle this on or off depending on whether you want all-day events to show in the widget.

* `Events without participants`: Toggle this on or off depending on whether you want events without participants, like a focus event or an out of office event, to show in the widget.

* `Events without conferencing/location`: Toggle this on or off depending on whether you want events that don’t have a conferencing link or a location to show in the widget.

**Note:**

* You can connect multiple Notion Calendar accounts to the Upcoming events widget in Home.

* If you’re in multiple Notion workspaces, don’t worry — you can adjust your Upcoming events widget differently for each!

## My tasks

My tasks shows all tasks assigned to you from all of the Task databases in your Notion workspace.

### Set up Task databases

**To see your assigned tasks in My tasks, you need to make sure that the databases containing those tasks are Notion Task databases.** A task database in Notion is a type of database that requires a status, assignee, and due date property to help you track the work that you need to get done.

## FAQs

### Why do I see duplicate tasks in My tasks?

If you’re seeing tasks that look the same in My tasks, it’s possible that you have multiple tasks with the same name across different Task databases. Check the URLs or databases that your tasks belong to, then consolidate any duplicates. To avoid any confusion in the future, you can consider having a different naming convention for different Task databases!
