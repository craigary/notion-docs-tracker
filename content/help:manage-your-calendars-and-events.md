### Change an event's location

To add or remove the location for an event, select the event and edit the `Location` field in the right context panel.

**Note:** At this time, travel time isn‚Äôt supported in Notion Calendar.

### Change your event type

In Notion Calendar, there are different kinds of events: `Event`, `Focus time`, `Out of office`, and `Birthday`.

When you‚Äôre creating a new event and that event‚Äôs name contains the word "birthday", Notion Calendar will automatically make that event a `Birthday` event. The event will become an all-day event that repeats every year.

You can change your event type at any time using Notion Calendar on desktop or web. To change your event type, click on the event, open the dropdown next to the event type, and choose your desired event type. You can also change an event into an `Availability`.

### Email participants

If an event appears on multiple calendars, and you want to edit the event from a specific calendar, toggle off the other calendars in your calendar list in the left sidebar so only the calendar that you want to use to edit is visible.
