**Note:**

* This feature is available to workspace **members** on all Notion plans.

* At this time, this feature isnâ€™t available on mobile devices.

People profiles help you learn more about and collaborate better with others in Notion. You can hover over peopleâ€™s names to quickly see what theyâ€™re working on, get in touch with them, or schedule time on their calendar.

## View someone's profile

**Note:&#x20;**&#x4F;nly members of a workspace can have and view hover cards and people profiles. Guests in a workspace canâ€™t view or have hover cards and people profiles.

Hover over a personâ€™s name in the following places to see a helpful card containing their information:

* @-mention in a page.

* In a comment, both inline or at the top of a page.

* In your inbox.

* In a person property of a database or wiki.

**Note:** If youâ€™re on the Enterprise Plan and pushing role information to Notion via SCIM, membersâ€™ roles will display in hover cards (but not people profiles).

Click on a personâ€™s name to view their full profile. In the profile, youâ€™ll see the following:

* Their top collaborators.

* Teamspaces they belong to.

* Their recent activity in your workspace.

You can also look for a user when by opening `Search` in your Notion sidebar.

## Update your profile

To change your name or profile photo, go to `Settings` â†’ `{your name}`.

To change the cover photo on your profile, go to your profile, hover over your current cover photo, and select `Change cover` or `Reposition`.

## Turn off hover cards and people profiles for a workspace

1. Go to `Settings`.

2. Select `General`.

3. Under `People`, toggle off `Profiles` or `Hover cards`.
