## Create a gallery

Here's how to to add a database in gallery view to Notion:

1. Create a new page in your workspace.

2. Under `Get started with`, click the `•••` and then `Gallery`.

If you want to create an inline gallery, type `/Gallery view` on any page and press `enter`.

### Add gallery view to a database

You can add a gallery to an existing database to view its data in that format.

1. Click `+` next to the name of your database or the name of your current database view.

2. Select `Gallery` from the dropdown menu.

## Customize your gallery

Edit your gallery so it does the job you need it to do. There are several ways to change its organization and appearance to fit the task at hand.

### Change card preview

To change the card preview:

1. Open the settings menu at the top right of your database → `Layout`.

2. Click `Card preview` and select from one of the following options.

   * `Page cover`: Will show the image you chose as your page's cover on your card.

   * `Page content`: Will show a preview of the page's content. If you have images on your page, the card will display whichever image comes first.

   * If you have a `Files & media` property in your database, you'll see the name of those properties in this menu. Your card will display whatever image files you’ve uploaded to these properties.

3. You can also toggle `Fit image` on or off.

   * When turned on, the entirety of the image will fit within the frame of the card. You can hover over an image in a card and select `Reposition` to drag the image into the position you want.

   * When turned off, the image will be cropped to fill the entire card frame.

### Rearrange cards

To reorder the cards in your gallery, just click and hold, then drag left, right, up, or down.

### Change card size

To change the size of your cards:

1. Open the settings menu at the top right of your database → `Layout`.

2. Click `Card size` and select an option from the dropdown.

**Tip:** You can also hide the name of any card in your gallery, allowing you to show the image as a standalone element. In the `Properties` menu, switch off `Name`. Helpful for simple and elegant mood boards and photo collections.

### Display, hide, and order properties

To choose how properties are displayed in your gallery:

1. Open the settings menu at the top right of your database → `Property visibility`.

2. Select `👁️` next to properties to show or hide them.

3. Use `⋮⋮` to drag your properties in the order in which you want them to be displayed in your gallery.

## FAQs

### How can I turn a full-page database into an inline database, or vice versa?

To change a full-page database into an inline database:

1. Drag the full-page database from your sidebar into another page. It will become a sub-page of that page.

2. Open the parent page, click the **`⋮⋮`** button next to the database sub-page, and select `Turn into inline`.

To change an inline database to a full-page database, drag an inline database block into your sidebar as a top-level page.


### I don’t want my database pages to open on the side or in the center of my page. Is there anyway to open a database page in full-screen by default?

Yes! To do this:

1. Open the settings menu at the top of your database.

2. Select `Layout` → `Open pages in` → `Full page`.


### How can I include an emoji in a tag, such as "🔥Urgent"?

Use your computer's emoji picker to include emojis inline on a Notion page, or anywhere else on your computer! Here are shortcuts to bring up the picker:

Mac: `ctrl` + `cmd` + `space`

Windows 10: `windows key` + `.` or `windows key` + `;`
