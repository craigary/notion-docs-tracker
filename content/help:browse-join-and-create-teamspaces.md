## Browse teamspaces

When you join a workspace on the Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, you'll automatically be added to any teamspaces that have been set as default. To see all other existing teamspaces in your workspace:

1. In your left sidebar, click `â€¢â€¢â€¢ More`.

2. At the top, youâ€™ll see teamspaces that you are a part of.

3. Below that, youâ€™ll see all open and closed teamspaces in the workspace.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x57;orkspaces on the Business Plan or Enterprise Plan have access to the private teamspace feature. Only members or owners of a private teamspace can invite other people, and it wonâ€™t be visible to people who are not added.

## Join or leave teamspaces

When browsing all teamspaces, you'll see a list of open and closed teamspaces in the workspace.

* Open teamspaces can be joined directly from this menu.

* Closed teamspaces will say close. Click `Request` next to a closed teamspace to request access.

To leave a teamspace that you are currently a member of:

1. Hover over the teamspace name in your sidebar.

2. Click the `â€¢â€¢â€¢` button and then choose the `Leave teamspace` option.

## Create a teamspace and become a teamspace owner

When setting up your workspace, you may want to create an additional teamspace.

* Scroll to the `Teamspaces` label in your sidebar and click the `+` button to the right of the label.

* To duplicate an existing teamspace, click the `â€¢â€¢â€¢` next to a teamspace and click `Duplicate teamspace`.

**Note:** Depending on your workspace settings, this action may be restricted to workspace owners only. You can check if this is the case by going to `Settings` â†’ `Teamspaces`.

When you create a teamspace, you will become the owner of this teamspace by default. You can add additional members and owners via the teamspace's settings:

1. Hover over the teamspace name in your sidebar.

2. Click the `â€¢â€¢â€¢` button and then choose the `Teamspace settings` option.

3. Click `Add members` or search for a member or group to add them to the teamspace.

4. Customize their role by clicking the dropdown to the right of their name.
