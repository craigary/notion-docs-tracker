**Note:** This feature is only available on the Business or Enterprise Plan.

Enterprise Search is a feature of Notion AI. It finds answers to your answers in just seconds, searching your workspace and your connected apps like Slack, Google Drive, Jira, and more.

When Enterprise Search answers a question using information from your workspace or a connected app, it'll always cite its sources so you can go back to the source.

Set up [Notion AI Connectors](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-connectors) for your third-party tools to include context from those tools in your search.

## Where to find Enterprise Search

To use Enterprise Search, open the `Home` tab in Notion and enter your question in the search window.

## Specify pages or people

If you want Notion AI to take certain pages or people into account when answering your question:

* Select `Add context` at the top of the Enterprise Search window. Find and select a particular page or person from your workspace.

* @-mention specific pages, teamspaces, and people directly in your query.

Keep in mind that Enterprise Search can even look closely at databases ‚Äî including database views, relations, and properties!

## Connect your third-party apps

Set up Notion AI Connectors to enhance your search with information from your team‚Äôs other tools. Connectors are available for Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Drive, Jira, and more. Learn about all of the available integrations and how to get started [here ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-connectors)

## Change the scope of your search

By default, Enterprise Search looks at all of the sources available, including your Notion workspace, any apps you‚Äôve connected via Notion AI Connectors, and the web. However, you can easily limit the scope of your search to a specific source to find what you‚Äôre looking for.

To change the scope of your search, select `All sources` in the Enterprise Search window in `Home`.

In the menu that appears, toggle `Web search` off if you don‚Äôt want Enterprise Search to search the web. Toggle `Apps and integrations` off if you don‚Äôt want Enterprise Search to look at your workspace or any connected apps.

If you want Enterprise Search to only look at a specific source (for example, only your workspace or only your Slack), select the name of the source in the menu. If you‚Äôre limiting the scope of your search to your workspace, you can make the scope even more specific by hovering over your workspace name and selecting a specific page or teamspace.

## Switch between AI models

You have access to multiple AI models when you use Enterprise Search. To choose a specific AI model for your search, select `Auto` in the Enterprise Search window in `Home`. In the menu that appears, choose from OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x4B;eep in mind that depending on the model you choose, Notion AI may look only at information from the web to help you with your work. It may not be able to look at information from your workspace or connected apps.
