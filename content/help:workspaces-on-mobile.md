## Navigating Notion for mobile

At the bottom of Notion for mobile, you'll see a navigation bar that is always present.

* Tap `üè†` on the bottom of any page to see familiar sections like `Shared`, `Private`, `Favorites` that match the desktop experience.

* Tap `üîç` to search your workspace.

* Tap `üì•` to check your `Inbox`.

* Tap `üìù` to create a new page.

## Teamspaces

If you are part of a multi-member workspace, you'll see a section in the `üè†` tab of your mobile app called `Teamspaces`.

Teamspaces are a dedicated area for every team within your organization or company, and can be customized on an individual basis. [Learn more about teamspaces ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/intro-to-teamspaces)

## Nested pages

Tap on the toggle next to any page in the `üè†` tab of your mobile app to reveal pages nested in other pages.

For database pages, you can toggle to see the different views of that database.

## Workspace switcher

Tap on your current workspace's name at the top of your `üè†` tab to switch to another workspace you belong to, create a new one, join another one, or log out.

## Creating on Notion for mobile

### Editor tools

While in a page, a toolbar appears above your keyboard. It contains all the options you need to add content to your page.

* Tap the `+` to see a full menu of other content block types you can add to your page. This replaces the `/` command functionality on desktop.

* From this toolbar, you can also @-mention a person or page, add a comment, insert an image, delete content, indent, select text color and highlight, and delete and duplicate a content block. Scroll horizontally to see all these options.

### ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ menu

The `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` menu contains additional options, including but not limited to:

* Choose from three different typography choices to format your page.

* `Customize page`: Toggle the visibility of backlink and page comment sections.

* `Lock page`**:** Turn this on to prevent edits from being made.

  * `Lock views:` Turn this on to prevent others from changing properties and views.

* `Page history`**:** View past versions of the page going back seven days (extended for paid plans).

* `Export`**:** Download the page as a file. Databases get saved as CSV files, while non-database pages get saved in Markdown. You can also export either as PDF or HTML.

* `Move to`**:** This opens up a menu where you can choose any other workspace or page to move the current page into.

### Share menu

Tap the share icon (square with upward arrow) to open this menu. From there, you can share the current page with others in a number of ways:

* `Share page link`: Tap this button at the top to open your mobile device's share sheet. You can copy the page link or directly share the URL.

* `Share to web`: Turn this on to publish your page to the web so anyone with the link can see it. Tap the dropdown menu that says `Show link options` for more control over permissions, duplication, and search engine indexing.

* `Add people, groups, or emails`: Tap this to invite other Notion users to the page.

  * `Everyone`: Turn this on to give every member in your workspace the ability to see the page. Tap the dropdown menu to the right and choose from `Full access`, `Can edit`, `Can comment`, `Can view` or `No access` to assign a level of access for people in your workspace.

  * `Groups`: You may also see groups that have been created in your workspace that you can assign different access levels to.

  * `Guests`: You can also add users outside of your workspace directly via email. They'll join as a [guest.](https://www.notion.com/notion/Guest-access-823e981ce5e44b348e6df0521f0f2c7c)

## Settings on mobile

### Notifications

Many more Notion settings are available on desktop. We've slimmed these down for mobile to include only:

* Notifications options for email and mobile push.

* The option to set, change, and remove a permanent password.

* The option to change your app appearance.

* The option to start calendar weeks on Monday instead of Sunday.

### Rage Shake

Rage Shake is a feature on Notion mobile (for Android) that allows users to report app issues by shaking their phone, triggering a notification to report a problem. To enable:

1. Click on `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` ‚Üí `Help & Support` and `Send a message`.

2. Toggle on `Shake phone to report`.

### Trash

* Tap to see deleted pages split into two categories: all deleted pages, and sub-pages deleted off the current page you're looking at.

* Tap the trash icon to delete a page forever.

* Tap the arced arrow icon to restore a page to your workspace.


## FAQs

### Can I switch between workspaces that are associated with different email addresses? 

To add your workspaces from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account. [More on this here ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/notion/Create-join-switch-workspaces-3b9be78982a940a7a27ce712ca6bdcf5#0a655487ba42450185b94d51a50c0855)


### My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?

The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, a¬†`Teamspaces`¬†section appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and the¬†`Private`¬†section is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.


### When I subscribe to a Plus Plan, does it cover all my workspaces?

Paid plans only apply to one workspace, and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate, so you won't be able to link any content between them.

We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.


### How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?

**Note:&#x20;**&#x41;ny migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information, [click here](https://www.notion.com/help/transfer-content-to-another-account).

To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and select `Move to`. <!-- -->At the bottom of the move menu, you‚Äôll see a drop down to select a different workspace.

When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in the `Private` section but can be moved wherever you want to put them.

### What if I accidentally deleted something permanently? Any way to get it back? 

If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help! Accidents happen üòÖ Just send us a message in the app by clicking `?` at the bottom left on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile). Or email us at email protected.

We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.


### How do I log out of my Notion account?

Click on your current workspace's name at the very top left of your sidebar. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see the option to¬†`Log out`¬†next to your email address.
