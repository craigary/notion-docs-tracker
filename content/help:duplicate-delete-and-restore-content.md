## Delete blocks

### Click ⋮⋮

The `⋮⋮` icon which we call the block handle, appears in the left margin when you hover over any line or content in Notion. Click it to see the `Delete` option.

### Click •••

When you hover over content like images, embeds, sub-pages, and web bookmarks, the `•••` icon appears in the top right corner of the block to let you `Delete`.

**On mobile,** you'll see this symbol in the corner of many content blocks. Tapping it will open a menu that includes `Delete`. For text on mobile, tap on `•••` all the way to the right in the toolbar that appears above your keyboard. You'll see the same set of options.

### Right click

You can right click on any content in Notion (or use the gesture that corresponds to right click on your trackpad) to bring up a menu that includes `Delete`.

### Keyboard shortcut

To delete, select any content block or text and hit the `delete` key.

## Delete pages

There are many ways to delete pages in Notion:

* Hover over the page in your left sidebar, select `•••` (or right click) and select `Delete` from the menu.

* Select `•••` at the very top right of a page and select `Delete` from the dropdown menu.

![Delete page •••](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/1h49x54cjhsOCTLNp9VRS4/866faf7de0ac5b252275b3c64a471d44/Delete_page__________.png)

* If you're deleting a sub-page from an existing page, hover over it and click on the **`⋮⋮`** icon (or right click) to see the option to `Delete`.

* Drag any page or content block into the `Trash` at the bottom of your left sidebar.

* You can always select any page block and press the `backspace` or `delete` keys.

## What happens when a page is deleted

By default, pages will remain in Trash for 30 days before they are permanently deleted from Trash.

Once pages are permanently deleted from Trash, they are retained for 30 days before they become inaccessible to all users, even workspace owners.

Enterprise Plan workspace owners may customize these settings. [Learn more here →](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-data-retention-settings)

## Find pages in Trash

Once you delete a page, it will end up in Trash. You'll see `Trash` at the bottom of your sidebar on both desktop and mobile. Once you open `Trash`, you can:

* Search for a specific page.

* Filter by the following:

  * `Last edited by`: The last person to edit the page.

  * `In`: The page that the deleted content used to live in.

  * `Teamspace`: The teamspace that the deleted content used to belong to.

* Open a deleted page to see its contents. From there, you can restore the page or permanently delete it from the trash. **Note that you won’t be able to edit a page that’s in the trash unless you restore it.**

On both iOS and Android, `Trash` is located in the `•••` menu in the top left of the sidebar.

## Version history

**Note:** A new version of a particular page will be recorded every 10 minutes as you actively edit it. Two minutes after you’ve made your last edit on a page, we will record another version.

If you're on an Enterprise Plan, you can view the history of all changes made to a page, including who made those changes and when.

If you're not on the Enterprise Plan, a more limited history of changes made to a page is available.**&#x20;**&#x59;ou can view and restore past versions of any Notion page going back:

* 7 days if you're on a Free Plan.

* 30 days if you're on a Plus Plan.

* 90 days if you're on a Business Plan.

* Any number of days if you're on an Enterprise Plan.

### See a page's version history

To access version history for a page, you will need at least `Can edit` access.

1. Click `•••` at the top of the page and choose `Version history`.

2. From the window that opens, you can:

   * See all past versions of the current page.

   * Click on any past version to see what the page looked like at that point in time.

You can also see this information by clicking `🕘` at the top of any Notion page. You'll see a dropdown menu of all revisions and comments made on the current page by yourself and others. Click the `🕓` next to any revision to jump to that version in a new window.

### Restore past versions of a page

* To recover only specific content blocks from a previous version, click on a certain version of a page, copy those blocks, and paste them into your current page.

* You can also restore a past version of a page so it becomes your current one. Open the desired version and click `Restore`.

* Even if you or someone on your team restores a past version, you can always go back to the page as it was during any point in the past 30 days. Just open `Version history` again, choose the version you want to return to, and restore it.

* If you’re restoring a database, all of its pages and their properties will be restored. However, any contents of the database pages, like text inside of the pages, won’t be restored. To restore database page contents, you’ll have to restore an earlier version of every individual page.

  * If you’re restoring a page with an [inline database](https://www.notion.com/help/intro-to-databases) (in other words, a database inside of a page), you can choose to restore or not restore the database’s pages and properties.

**Note:** Restoring a database may affect existing database views, as well as how other people see the database.

### Version history on mobile

Version history works a bit differently on mobile that it does on the web or desktop. To access page history:

1. Click the `•••` icon at the top of your page.

2. Tap `Version history`. You'll see a full list of versions organized by time.

   * Tap any version to view it. You can copy and paste any content you want from it into your current version, or tap `Restore` at the top of the screen to make that version current.

## Delete properties from a database

There are many ways to delete properties from a database in Notion.

1. Click on the Settings menu in the corner of the database you want to edit.

2. Select `Edit Properties.`

3. Click on the property you want to delete.

4. Select `Delete property.`

### What happens when a property is deleted

Deleted properties can be viewed, restored, or permanently deleted from the Settings menu. To view deleted properties in a database:

1. Click on the Settings menu in the corner of the database you want to edit.

2. Select `Edit Properties.`

3. Scroll down to `Deleted Properties.`

To restore a property, click the arrow. To permanently delete a property, click the trash can. Deleting a property from `Deleted Properties` is **permanent&#x20;**&#x61;nd cannot be restored.


## FAQs

### I tried duplicating some blocks, but got a Please try again later error.

This error means that you've hit our duplication rate limit — right now you can only duplicate 20,000 blocks per hour. Our apologies for the incovenience!

If you wait a bit, you'll be able to duplicate the content then 👍


### What if I accidentally deleted something permanently? Any way to get it back? 

If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help! Accidents happen 😅 Just send us a message in the app by clicking `?` at the bottom of your sidebar, or email us at email protected.

We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.


### How can I empty my trash?

There isn’t a way to empty your trash all at once. You can go in and delete individual pages from the trash — otherwise, pages in the trash will be automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days.

Enterprise plan workspace owners may customize these settings. [Learn more here →](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-data-retention-settings)


### Can I use page history to restore a version that's over 30 days old?

You can if you're on a [Business or Enterprise Plan](https://www.notion.com/pricing)! [Contact sales to learn more→](https://notionup.typeform.com/to/FbZ6Tk)
