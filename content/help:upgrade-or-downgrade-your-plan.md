Plus Plan subscriptions purchased on mobile are limited to workspaces with only one member. If you want to upgrade to the Plus Plan for a workspace with multiple members, you’ll have to do that desktop or web.

## FAQs

### How is the Free Plan different from the Plus Plan?

The Plus Plan supports additional members, so multiple people can share a collaborative workspace together. It also includes some extra features like more version history, larger file uploads and more guests. Compare plans in more detail on [our pricing page →](https://www.notion.com/pricing)


### What is a block?

A block is any single piece of content you add to your page, like a paragraph of text, a to-do item, an image, a code block, an embedded file, etc. Think of your page as being made up of these building blocks. Learn more about blocks [here →](https://www.notion.com/help/what-is-a-block)


### Can I use Notion for free?

Absolutely! The Free Plan is completely free for individual use.

If you add additional members to the Free Plan, you can collaborate with with a limit block trial, which provides more than enough to try out Notion with your team before upgrading to the Plus Plan.


### Do you offer student discounts?

The Plus Plan (with a 1-member limit) is free for students and educators. Compared to the Free Plan, you’ll be able to add more guests, have access to more version history, and upload larger files.

Just sign up with your school email address and you’ll immediately gain access to these features. Thousands of school email domains are eligible, not just .edu!

For more info & FAQs, [visit the Notion for Education page](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-for-education).


### How is pricing calculated for the paid plans?

If you upgrade your workspace to one of the paid plans, you will be charged a fee per member.

Guests are free of charge – but they can only access individual pages they are invited to. In other words, guests won’t be able to see all the team pages under the `Teamspaces` section in the left sidebar.


### Do you have monthly and yearly billing options?

Yes! We offer both monthly and yearly billing options, but you save more with yearly billing. [Find more information on monthly and yearly pricing for our plans here →](https://www.notion.com/pricing)


### How does adding and removing members work?

Whether you're on a monthly or yearly billing schedule, your account may be charged on a monthly basis if you make changes in membership. If you added members, your account will be charged a prorated amount based on the percentage of the billing cycle left when a user was added. If you removed members, you will not receive credit but instead will still have use of that seat for a different user for the remainder of the billing period.


### What happens when I change plans?

* **Upgrading your plan:** Your account will be upgraded and charged immediately. The amount due will be reduced based on the percentage of the billing cycle left at the time the plan was changed.

* **Downgrading your plan:&#x20;**&#x59;our account will be downgraded at the end of your billing cycle. Learn about how your features may be impacted after a downgrade [here →](https://www.notion.com/help/plan-downgrade)


### How do I cancel my paid plan?

Your Notion subscription, annual or monthly, will automatically renew until you cancel it. You can cancel your subscription by going to `Settings` in the left-hand sidebar on a desktop computer, then selecting `Billing`, then `Change plan`. After you cancel, you’ll still have access to all the paid features until the end of your billing cycle.

Learn more about billing in [this article](https://www.notion.com/help/billing-and-payment-info).


### What happens if my payment fails? Like if my credit card expires?

Your account email will be notified after each failed payment. Payments may be retried up to 8 times within the next month.

After this, if the payment did not succeed, your workspace will get restricted to limited-access for a period of time before being downgraded to the Free plan.


### Can I change my payment method?

You can change your payment method at any time in your billing settings.


### How do refunds work?

Our refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or email email protected. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount (not pro-rated) if you downgrade your subscription within three days of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.

If you have accidentally added members to your workspace, you can remove those members at any time. If you’ve been charged for members who were accidentally added, we're happy to provide a refund of the prorated charges if you reach out within three days of the invoice date (please make sure the additional members have been removed from your workspace when writing in).

And if for any reason you're unhappy with Notion, please let us know at email protected — we'd love to hear your feedback, and will be happy to work with you to create the best experience possible.


### Do you have a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)?

We do not offer a standard SLA. For teams with greater than 100 members, we can offer a custom SLA.

[Contact sales](https://www.notion.com/contact-sales) to learn more


### How is my payment being processed?

We use Stripe to process your payment. It’s the same payment provider used by products such as Twitter, Pinterest, and Lyft. We do not handle your credit card information directly.


### Can I belong to multiple teams on Notion?

Yes! You can use the same email address to create and join multiple teams. However, each one of these workspaces is on its own plan and needs to be upgraded individually.


### Can I change my plan settings on mobile?

No, you can only make modifications to your Notion plan on desktop or web.
