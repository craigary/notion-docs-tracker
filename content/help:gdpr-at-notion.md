The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that regulates the use of EU residentsâ€™ personal data, providing individuals rights to exercise control over their data and requiring organizations that process personal data to meet certain obligations.

## Data portability & management tools

* **Import:&#x20;**&#x57;e currently provide tools to import from text & markdown files, CSV, Microsoft Word, HTML, Trello, Asana, Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Quip, Evernote, and Workflowy. We plan to add more import options in the future, based on user feedback.

* **Export:&#x20;**&#x4E;otion supports exporting in two ways. It is possible to export an entire workspace from the workspace settings menu. This will create a folder containing all documents in markdown format. Additionally, pages can be exported individually by navigating to them and selecting the export option from the page menu.

* **Workspace deletion:&#x20;**&#x41; workspace can be deleted at any time from the workspace settings menu. Upon requesting to delete a workspace, all content will immediately become inaccessible. After 30 days, the content will be deleted from our servers and can no longer be recovered.

* **Workspace settings:&#x20;**&#x57;e provide tools to manage other workspace settings, such as name, members, and allowed email domains from our workspace settings menu.

## Data transfers

In light of the recent Schrems II ruling, we rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) to ensure appropriate safeguards for personal data transfers from the EU to countries outside of the EU.Â  For more information about our technical security measures, please see our [Security and Privacy Page](https://www.notion.com/security).

## Subprocessors

We work with certain companies and tool systems to provide our services to you. They've been carefully vetted for best-in-class security practices. For more information, see our [List of Subprocessors.](https://www.notion.com/notion/Notion-s-List-of-Subprocessors-268fa5bcfa0f46b6bc29436b21676734)
