## Databases are collections of pages

Think of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database.

This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents.

## Databases are pages themselves

But wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page.

## Databases have properties

To help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.

You can then search, filter, and sort by these property values. Learn more about database properties [here ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/database-properties)

## Database views display the same content in different ways

The contents of a database can be visualized as a table, list, board, calendar, gallery, timeline, or chart ‚Äî whatever makes the information the most useful.
