When you sign up with Notion Calendar, your Notion account is used (or a Notion account is created for you using the same email address). Only one Notion account can be linked to your Notion Calendar account, even if you have multiple calendars or Notion workspaces integrated with your Notion Calendar account.

This means that if you lose access to the Notion account connected to Notion Calendar, youâ€™ll also lose access to your Notion Calendar.

## Manage your Notion Calendar profile

Your Notion Calendar profile details are synced with your Notion profile details. To update your profile photo or name, go to `Settings` â†’ `{your name}` in Notion. Learn more about Notion account settings [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/account-settings)
