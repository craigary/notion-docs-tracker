The U.S. government has [introduced restrictions](https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/932951/download?inline) prohibiting access to certain software products and services to any person in Russia. Due to these restrictions, **on September 9, 2024, Notion will no longer provide users located in Russia access to the platform**. This includes:

* **Preventing users from accessing Notion’s services while in Russia.&#x20;**&#x55;sers in workspaces that have never had billing associated with Russia will be able to regain access to Notion once outside Russia.

* If any billing information connected with the workspace is currently or was previously associated with Russia, the **workspace will be terminated**. This is necessary for compliance with sanctions, and updating an account’s billing information will not change the restriction.

* **Terminating subscription payments** for all plans identified as having any billing information associated with Russia, historical or current.

Impacted users will be able to access their workspaces through September 8, 2024. On September 9, 2024, the workspaces will no longer be accessible and users located in Russia will no longer be able to access Notion’s services.

Impacted users who are no longer in Russia and no longer using billing information associated with Russia may be able to create a new account. Those users will also be able to access other Notion workspaces which do not have billing information associated with Russia. We recommend exporting your data as a precaution.

We understand this change may be disruptive.
