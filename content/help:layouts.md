Layouts let you customize the way properties are organized in your database pages. With layouts, you can make pages in one database look distinct from pages in another database, depending on their use. For example, pages in your database for weekly marketing reports can be built to look very different from your database for team tasks.

Layouts also help you keep your database pages clean and easy to navigate, especially when you‚Äôre working with lots of properties. You can bring certain properties to the forefront while keeping others out of sight, all depending on what‚Äôs most important to you and your team.

**Note:**

* To build a database page layout, you must have at least `Can edit` access to the database.

* A page layout will apply to all pages in the database. Layouts can‚Äôt be applied only to specific pages or specific views.

## Build a layout

**Note:** While you can view layouts on mobile, you‚Äôll only get the full layout builder experience on desktop or web.

To build a layout:

1. Open the database as a [full page (not inline)](https://www.notion.com/help/intro-to-databases#full-page-vs.-inline-databases) and select `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` at the top.

2. Select `Customize layout`. Use the page preview toggle under the database name to see how your layout changes will look for any page in the database.

You‚Äôll see a few components in this layout builder:

* A `Heading` with the name of your page and room to pin specific properties

* A main page area containing a `Property group` with your database properties

* A details panel on the right side

* Some `Page settings`

## Heading and pinned properties

To customize your `Heading`:

1. Click on the `Heading`. You‚Äôll see a list of your database properties to the right of the screen.

2. Under `Unpinned properties`, click `üìå` next to a property to pin it. You can pin up to **four properties**.

3. If you want to create new properties that you want pinned, click `Add a property` under `Pinned properties`.

4. You can also open the dropdown next to `Backlinks` and choose whether you want to `Always show` backlinks, `Show on hover` only, or turn them `Off`. Learn more about backlinks [here ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/create-links-and-backlinks#backlinks)

## Main page

Your main page area is the space underneath your page‚Äôs heading. It‚Äôs a large area ideal for storing properties with lots of information in them, like sub-items or text properties. Your `Property group` will be displayed here by default, but you can move it to your details panel on the side, or create new modules in your main page to highlight specific properties.

## Property group

Your `Property group` shows you the properties of your database page and can be displayed in the main page or in the details panel. Each layout has one `Property group`.

All of your properties are displayed here to start, but when you pin a property to your `Heading` or move a property into its own module in the main page or the details panel, it will no longer be shown in your `Property group`.

To customize your `Property group`:

1. Click on the `Property group`. You‚Äôll see a list of your database properties to the right of the screen.

2. You can show or hide specific properties by clicking `üëÅÔ∏è` next to them.

3. You can organize your properties by clicking `Add section` at the top of your `Property group` settings. If you only have one section, all the properties in your `Property group` will fall under that section.

4. Create as many sections as you‚Äôd like, and give each section a name. When you have more than one section, you can drag properties into a section to organize them.

You can also edit a property from directly inside the layout builder by clicking on its name in the property group settings.

## Details panel

The details panel on the right side of your database page can be opened and closed. To customize the details panel:

1. Click `Add to panel`.

2. You can create a new property to display here, or select an existing property.

3. You can also display the `Property group` or any other module you‚Äôve created here.

## Page settings

Select `Page settings` at the top of the layout builder to make further adjustments to your page.

### Structure

Layouts can take on different structures:

* The `Simple` layout structure shows your properties and page contents across the main page and the details panel.

* The `Tabbed` layout structure allows you to organize your layout by tab. One tab is a `Content` tab that contains the page‚Äôs contents and layout modules, and you can add more tabs that contain views of other databases from your workspace. For example, if you‚Äôre in a project database, you can set up a tab that shows you all of the tasks associated with that project.

  ![hc: tabbed layout](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/5VR0XOwHpPQ3HyqjbmGjLc/acd6f076eaeeb01d92f1775fa998b552/tabbed_layout.gif)

### Options

There are a variety of options you can adjust:

* You can decide if you‚Äôd like inline comments on your page to be displayed as they are by `Default` (with the comment visible alongside the commenter‚Äôs profile photo), or displayed in a `Minimal` way (with only the number of comments showing, which you can click to expand).

* You can decide if you‚Äôd like your [page discussions](https://www.notion.com/help/comments-mentions-and-reminders), or comments that are added at the page level, to be `Expanded` (with all comments showing) or `Off` (not showing).

* You can choose to show or hide `Property icons`. If you hide property icons, only property names will be visible in pages.

* You can make your page `Full width`.

## Save and apply your layout

Once you‚Äôre done customizing your layout, click `Apply to all pages` at the top. Every page in your database will have the same layout, and new pages you create will also have that layout.

You can also reset a layout, meaning your database pages will look the way they did before any layouts were applied. To do this, open the dropdown next to `Apply to all pages` and select `Reset to original page layout`. No properties will be deleted.

![hc: apply to pages or reset](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/5Lro3UtqT11khp9xdKtbeY/a9450d3ed1205d587396ba699e4d9eab/Reference_visuals__4_.png)

When you open a database page with a custom layout, you can open and close the details panel by selecting `View details` at the top of the page.

![hc: view details panel](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/LdPgtqQpyygy9vFDd8ZTW/8a971e0454cbbdcd83bc79e08ce7c804/open_and_close_details.gif)

## Add a module

You can highlight specific properties as their own modules in your database page. To do this:

1. Click `+` in your main page or details panel.

2. You can create a new property to display here, or select an existing property.

## Move modules

It‚Äôs easy to move different parts of your layout around to fit your needs. To do so, you can either:

* Click and drag a module to your desired location.

* Click `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` at the top of a module and select `Move up`, `Move down`, `Move to panel`, or `Move to page`.

To remove a module from the layout, click `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` at the top of the section and select `Remove from layout`.

**Note:**

* You can‚Äôt move or remove a page‚Äôs `Heading`.

* You can‚Äôt remove the `Property group`.

* Some properties, like `Relation`, can‚Äôt be moved to the details panel.
