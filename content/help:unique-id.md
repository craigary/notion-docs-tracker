Unique ID is a database property that helps you manage projects and organize tasks. Once the property is added, IDs are automatically created for each new and existing database item.

## Adding unique IDs

Connect GitHub to Notion so you can get the most out of your unique ID property!

* [GitHub Integrations](https://www.notion.com/integrations/github-cdc46cd9-f0e9-48fd-b3aa-18481098e29e)

* [Integrate GitHub (Help Center)](https://www.notion.com/help/github)

While in any database:

1. Click the `+` at the far right side of the database to add a new property.

2. Select `ID`.

   * The prefix will be generated automatically based on the names of the teamspace and database, but you can change this anytime in the text box.

### **Unique ID URL**

All pages with the unique ID property can be accessed via a special URL with the ID number. For example, if a page has the ID: `TASK-123` you can get to that page through `notion.so/TASK-123`.

**Unique ID URLs will only work if your unique ID has a prefix.&#x20;**&#x54;o make sure your unique IDs contain a prefix, click on the ID property in a database, select `Edit property`, and check that the `Prefix` field is not empty.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x55;nique ID numbers always start at 1 and are assigned to every page, including deleted pages. ID numbers will never change.
