**Note:** The audit log feature is available to [organization owners](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls#who-can-apply-organization-level-controls) on the Enterprise Plan. If you upgrade to an Enterprise Plan, audit log events are recorded starting from the time of upgrade. Prior events will not be included in the audit log.

Audit logs give you information about events that happen across your organization‚Äôs workspaces, as well as who took specific actions and when. Where available, the IP address is also included.

By default, all events are shown in reverse chronological order. You can use the filters at the top of the audit log to find the information you‚Äôre looking for.
