## Publish a Notion Site

**Note:**

* Making a Notion page public via Notion Sites is different from making a Notion page public using the `Anyone on the web with link` setting in a pageâ€™s `Share` menu. Learn more about this general access setting [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/sharing-and-permissions#general-access)

* Workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can choose to prevent Notion Sites from being published. Learn how [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing#prevent-members-from-publishing-notion-sites)

To publish a Notion Site:

1. Open the page you want to publish and select `Share` at the top.

2. Open the `Publish` tab.

3. Select `Publish`.

Select `View site` to see your Notion Site live on the web! As you make changes to the content in a published Notion page, the Site will update automatically.

### Make your site embeddable

Embed any of your published Notion pagesâ€”forms, charts, databases, and moreâ€”into your non-Notion websites.

1. On a published page, click `Embed this page`.

2. On the embed modal, click `Copy this code`.

   * Optionally, you can toggle `Show page title`.

3. Paste the code into your website's HTML file, if you are using a website builder, this will probably be a code block.

**Note**: Publishing a Notion page to the web means all of its subpages will be published too. Make sure all your pageâ€™s subpages are good to go before you hit publish!

## Adjust settings for your Notion Site

Once your Notion Site is published, open the published page in Notion and select `Share` at the top â†’ `Publish`. From this menu, you can:

* Copy the link to your live Notion Site so you can share it with others.

* If youâ€™re on a paid plan, you can customize your Notion Site slug, which is the pathname that follows your domain. For example, in the URL `notion.site/my-slug`, `my-slug` would be the slug. To customize this, click on your current slug, enter your preferred slug, and click `Save`.

  * Slugs can be made up of letters, numbers, and hyphens. No other special characters are allowed.

  * Your slug can contain up to 60 characters.

  * Home pages canâ€™t have slugs.

  * Youâ€™ll have to set up slugs manually for each of your Notion Sites. A particular pageâ€™s slug wonâ€™t automatically apply to any subpages.

  * You canâ€™t use the same slug across pages in a workspace, even if those pages are published to different domains.

**Important:** Once you permanently delete a published page, its slug cannot be reused. If you think you might want to use the same slug again, update the slug *before* deleting the page.

* Select `Site customization` to further personalize your Site. Learn more about customizing your site in [this article â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/edit-and-customize-your-notion-sites)

* Select `Search engine indexing` and toggle on `Discoverable on the web` to make your site searchable on the web. If youâ€™re on a paid plan, youâ€™ll also be able to edit your link title and description for search engine optimization.

* Toggle on `Duplicate as template` to allow your site visitors to duplicate your Notion Site as a Notion page in their own workspace.

* Select `Embed this page` and toggle on `Show page title` or select `Copy code` to embed your Notion Site into another page.

* Manage all of your sites by selecting `All published sites`.

**Note:**

* Notion Sites can take up to four weeks to be indexed and appear in search results.

* If you choose to sell templates directly on [Marketplace](https://www.notion.com/help/selling-on-marketplace), your existing paid templates (at their existing Notion Sites links) will be made available for purchase **directly on Marketplace**. This means that users who access your templates' existing Notion Sites links via a third-party platform wonâ€™t be able to duplicate your templates. Make sure to **duplicate your template and set it up at a new Notion Site link** that you can use for your listing on the third-party platform.

## How visitors interact with your Notion Site

**Note**: When you publish a Notion page to the web, the webpageâ€™s metadata may include the names, profile photos, and email addresses associated with any Notion users that have contributed to the page.

When you publish a Notion Site:

* Anyone on the web can view it.

* Subpages are also published by default, along with any of their subpages. You can restrict subpage permissions to hide them from public view!

* If your Notion Site contains a database, viewers can toggle between views and open the pages within.

* Depending on the [settings](https://www.notion.com/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing#adjust-settings-for-your-notion-site) youâ€™ve toggled on and the [customizations](https://www.notion.com/help/edit-and-customize-your-notion-sites#customize-your-header) you make, viewers can also duplicate or search your Site.

* As you make changes to the content in your Notion page, the Site will update automatically.

If youâ€™re on a paid plan, you can do even more to tailor the experience for your Siteâ€™s visitors! Learn how in [this article â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/edit-and-customize-your-notion-sites)

## Unpublish your Notion Site

Even if your Notion Site has been unpublished, itâ€™s possible your pageâ€™s [general access settings](https://www.notion.com/help/sharing-and-permissions#general-access) have been set to `Anyone on the web with link`, which allows people who have the link to your page to access it.

To ensure your pageâ€™s contents arenâ€™t shared publicly, turn this setting off by clicking `Share` at the top of your Notion page, opening the dropdown next to `Anyone on the web with link`, and clicking `Remove`.

To take your Notion Site off the web:

1. Open the page you want to unpublish and select `Share` at the top.

2. Open the `Publish` tab.

3. Select `Unpublish`.

## Prevent members from publishing Notion Sites

If youâ€™re a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan, you can prevent workspace members from publishing Notion Sites. To do this, workspace owners can:

1. Go to `Settings` â†’ `Security`.

2. In the `Security` tab, toggle on `Disable publishing sites, forms, and public links`.

Any Sites already live on the web will be taken down once you turn this setting on. Note that turning this setting on will also prevent members of your workspace from sharing [forms](https://www.notion.com/help/forms) to the web.

## FAQs

### Does Notion support custom domains?

Learn how to claim a `notion.site` domain or connect a custom domain to your Notion Site [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/manage-your-notion-sites#manage-your-domains)


### Can you link to a specific section of a page?

You can use a [table of contents](https://www.notion.com/help/columns-headings-and-dividers#table-of-contents) in your public page to create anchor links to its headings.


### If I change my workspace domain name, will my public page URLs still work?

If you change your workspace domain, any existing links starting with the previous domain will no longer work. You'll need to share the new link. To find the new link, <!-- -->open the published page in Notion and select `Share` at the top â†’ `Publish`. Find the URL at the top and select `ðŸ”—` next to it to copy it.


### I shared my public page URL but it takes people to a page with a "Continue to external site by following the link below" error message. What did I do wrong?

Make sure youâ€™ve shared the link to the published page, and not the version of the page in your Notion workspace! The link should begin with your Notion workspace domain name. <!-- -->To find it, open the published page in Notion and select `Share` at the top â†’ `Publish`. Find the URL at the top and select `ðŸ”—` next to it to copy it.


### Can I password protect a page?

Unfortunately, not at the moment. If the person you want to share a page with has a Notion account, you can share your page privately by selecting `Invite a person`Â in theÂ `Share`Â menu at the top of a page.
