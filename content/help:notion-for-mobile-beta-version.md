## Notion beta for iOS

### How to sign up

Like many other apps, Notion’s iOS beta is distributed through TestFlight.

1. [Go here to install the TestFlight app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) on your device if you don’t have it already.

2. Once the TestFlight app is downloaded to your device, [click on this link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/YSo8aVCS) to download the Notion iOS beta app. If you already have the standard Notion app installed, the beta version will replace it.

## Becoming a mobile beta tester

Participation is entirely voluntary. Before you sign up, please keep in mind that by accessing and using our beta apps, you are acknowledging and accepting any risks from using an app that has not yet been released to the general public. For example, beta apps can contain more bugs than our publicly available products.

Your decision to participate in beta testing is also subject to any applicable Beta Services terms in your [agreements](https://notion.notion.site/Terms-and-Privacy-28ffdd083dc3473e9c2da6ec011b58ac) with us. If you’re using the mobile app to access your company’s Notion workspace, you may need to check with your IT department before installing beta software.
