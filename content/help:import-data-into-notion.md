## How to import

**Note:** You can only import content on desktop or web, not on mobile.

* Notion lets you directly import the following file types:

  * Plaintext (.txt)

  * Markdown (.md or .markdown)

  * Microsoft Word (.docx)

  * CSV (.csv)

  * HTML (.html)

  * PDF (.pdf)

* You can also import data from a number of apps like Confluence, Asana, Evernote, and Trello, among others.

**There are a few ways you can import data:**

* Type `/` and type the content you want to import â€“ like `csv` or `Trello`.

* Go to `Settings` in your sidebar, then select `Import`. This will bring up a window where you can choose which app or file type to import from.

   * Or you can type `/csv`.

2. Upload whatever `.csv` files you want to import from your computer.

**Alternatively, you can add a CSV to an existing database:**

1. While in a full page database, click `â€¢â€¢â€¢` at the top of a database â†’ `Merge with CSV`.

2. Setup the CSV columns by matching them to Notion properties.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x46;or the best experience uploading your CSV into Notion:

* Make sure the first row of your CSV is the header row.

* Make sure CSV files are in UTF-8 format to allow for better parsing.

* Dates will be imported into Notion in MM/DD/YYYY format.

* If any column contains mixed data types, Notion will default to string to avoid data loss.

* The first text column of the CSV that doesnâ€™t use rich text formatting will be set as the primary key for the database. Make sure to reorder accordingly.

* If youâ€™re looking to import a CSV into an existing database, make sure that the first row in your CSV has the exact same names as the properties in the database youâ€™re looking to upload into.

* Imports from CSV to existing database will add rows to the database, not update existing rows. Watch out for duplicate data.

* CSV columns cannot be merged with a Notion relation property.

## PDF

**Note:** This feature is in beta, which means itâ€™s still a work in progress. Thank you for your patience!

There are several ways to import a PDF into Notion:

* Use the slash command `/import` and select `PDF`.

* Use the slash command `/pdf` and select `PDF` â€” make sure youâ€™re importing, not embedding!

* Open `Settings` and select `Import` â†’ `PDF`.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x57;hen your PDFâ€™s contents are converted to a Notion page, itâ€™s possible that some formatting elements of your PDF may not be preserved. For example:

* Tables will be converted to simple tables instead of databases.

  * Images, attachments, bullet lists, and numbered lists in simple tables arenâ€™t supported.

* Headings, equations, and quotes may appear as plain text.

* Toggles, to-dos, code, callouts, and dividers may not appear as originally formatted.

* Font and background colors aren't supported.

The PDF importer is optimized to convert text for better search and accessibility via Notion AI. You may need to make slight adjustments to your Notion page to get it to look just the way you want.

Once your PDF is imported, its contents will be accessible via Notion search and Notion AI!


## FAQs

### Which versions of Confluence are supported?

We officially support importing from Confluence Cloud, in pages created using the new editor that Confluence introduced in late 2018.

Due to insufficient data in its index export, we do not support importing from Confluence Server.

For help importing an entire workspace from the legacy editor, please contact support at email protected.


### Do imported blocks count towards the storage limit for Free Plan workspaces with multiple members?

No, imported blocks will not count towards the limit. However, any blocks subsequently created inside imported pages will count towards the limit as usual.


### Is there a maximum import size for Confluence imports?

Confluence imports are limited to 5GB for zip-file imports and 30 GB for API imports.

If you run into the limit, you can try using the **Custom Export** option to select pages for export, omitting attachment-heavy pages.


### When I try to import from Confluence, I can't choose my file in the file upload window.

Please make sure to upload a `.zip` file created by the Confluence space export functionality. Word documents and standalone HTML files will not work, since Notion relies on the whole import to preserve structure and links between pages.


### I can't find the option to export my Confluence workspace.

If the "Export" tab does not appear in the Content Tools section of a workspace's settings, you may not have the appropriate permissions to export pages. Ask the workspace administrator for permission.


### I can't seem to import from Evernote China/Evernote Business.

Unfortunately, our importer only supports the standard edition of Evernote at the moment. We're working on it!
