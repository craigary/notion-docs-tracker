## Insert an embed

1. Click theÂ `+`Â that appears to the left when you hover over a new line. ChooseÂ `Embed`Â or one of the common embed types listed above. PressÂ `enter`.

2. In the menu that appears, paste the content's URL or embed link.

   * You can also useÂ `/embed`Â to upload and display your own image, audio, video, or file. Just selectÂ `Upload`Â and choose the file from your computer.

**Note:**Â Some websites prohibit their content from being embedded elsewhere. If you receive aÂ `Failed to Load`Â error, that's why.

## Embeds in Notion

Notion allows you to embed external content from over 1,900 domains via the [Iframely](https://iframely.com/) service. This enables you to bring videos, screencasts, slide decks, images, audio, code repositories, and more into your Notion pages, so that you can keep all context in one place. As needed to display embedded content, Iframely and the embedded app may receive the IP address of the content's viewers.

Here is a selection of some of the commonly used apps that you can embed into your Notion pages:

|             |            |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Abstract    | Canva      |
| CodePen     | Excalidraw |
| Facebook    | Flocus     |
| Framer      | Indify     |
| Instagram   | Invision   |
| GitHub Gist | GIPHY      |
| Google Maps | LinkedIn   |
| Loom        | Miro       |
| Mixpanel    | Pinterest  |
| Reddit      | Replit     |
| Sketch      | Streamlit  |
| Slideshare  | Spotify    |
| Tableau     | Tally      |
| TikTok      | Twitter    |
| Typeform    | Vimeo      |
| Widgetbox   | YouTube    |

While pretty much any online content can be embedded on a page, Notion also has preconfigured embed blocks for some of the commonly used media types (e.g., File, Image, PDF, Video) and apps (CodePen, Loom, Miro, Tweet).

These can be added specifically from theÂ `/`Â menu or by clickingÂ `+`Â in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line. Try it out by typingÂ `/tweet`Â to embed a Tweet, orÂ `/maps`Â to embed an interactive Google Map.

**Note:** Embeds that require login to an external site will not work on Notion's desktop app or mobile apps.

### Supported file types

In Notion, you can embed:

* HTML files

* PDF files

* Audio

* Video

* Images

## Embed actions and options

### Turn a URL into an embed

****In most cases, Notion will recognize an embeddable URL when you paste it into your page. You can also paste copied images.

1. Paste the embed URL provided by the content's source.

   * For example, this should start with `https` not `<iframe`.

2. In the menu that appears, select `Paste as bookmark`.

### Resize and arrange embeds

Most embeds can be resized to suit their content and the format of your page.

* Hover your mouse over your embed, then drag the black bars that appear on the sides.

* Use drag-and-drop to move embeds around your page. Hover over the embed in question, then use theÂ `â‹®â‹®` icon that appears as a handle to drag it.

* You can also drag and drop embeds into columns.

### Go to an embed's source

It's easy to link back to where the embed came from.

1. Hover over your embed and clickÂ `Original`. Your browser will take you to its source.

2. You can also hover over the embed and clickÂ `â‹®â‹®`Â on the left orÂ `â€¢â€¢â€¢`Â at its top right corner.

3. SelectÂ `View Original`Â and your browser will open to the source page.

### Replace embedded content

As your project evolves, you'll likely need to update embedded content. You can replace both content you've embedded from elsewhere online, or content you've uploaded in order to embed and display it on your page.

1. Hover over the embed and clickÂ `â‹®â‹®`Â on the left orÂ `â€¢â€¢â€¢`Â at its top right. ChooseÂ `Replace`.

2. When prompted, chooseÂ `Embed link` or `Upload`.

3. Paste the new URL from the online service, or select the new file.

**Note:**Â If the source of your embed changes in any way, that change will appear in Notion too.

## Web bookmarks

Bookmarks are one way to incorporate web links into your Notion page. They appear like distinct blocks with the page title, description and URL displayed.

1. Copy and paste the URL.

2. In the menu that appears, select `Paste as bookmark`.

## Link mentions

Link mentions are another way to incorporate links into your Notion page. They appear inline, similar to text, and are more subtle than bookmarks.

1. Copy and paste the URL.

2. In the menu that appears, select `Paste as mention`.

## Connect other apps

**Note:&#x20;**&#x4F;n Enterprise Plans, the following can be restricted to workspace owners:

* The ability to [add connections](https://www.notion.com/help/add-and-manage-connections-with-the-api#add-connections-in-your-workspace) and decide who can connect or disconnect integrations at the page level.

* The ability to [install workspace-wide security and compliance integrations](https://www.notion.com/help/add-security-and-compliance-integrations).

### Integrate with Zoom

We now support Zoom meeting link previews in Notion and managing weekly Zoom meetings in calendar view. For projects with recurring Zoom invites, you can preview meeting URL information and join meetings straight from Notion.

1. Paste a Zoom meeting link URL into a Notion page.

2. Similarly to other link previews, you'll have to authenticate the app the very first time you paste a corresponding link in Notion. Click theÂ `Connect to Zoom to update`Â button to open the authentication window and grant the necessary permissions.

3. Youâ€™ll have the option toÂ `Paste as mention`Â orÂ `Paste as preview`.

At any time, you can uninstall the Zoom app by navigating to `Settings` â†’ `Connections` and selecting `Delete`.

### Embed from Google Drive

You can search your Google Drive from inside Notion and embed content without having to navigate away from the app. Here's how:

1. Click theÂ `+`Â that appears to the left when you hover over a new line. Scroll and chooseÂ `Google Drive`Â from the menu.

2. You can also typeÂ `/drive`Â and pressÂ `enter`.

3. A block will appear with a pop-up menu where you can either paste the URL to the Google Doc or Sheet you want to embed, or you can clickÂ `Browse Google Drive`Â to search your Drive for the right file.

4. You can connect multiple Google accounts to embed files from multiple Google Drives.

### Embed a Google Calendar

You can embed a view-only Google Calendar into Notion if the Gmail address you use for your calendar is the same one you use for Notion.

1. UnderÂ `My calendars`, click on theÂ `â‹®`Â next to the calendar you'd like to embed and chooseÂ `Settings and sharing`.

2. UnderÂ `Access permissions` checkÂ `Make available to public`Â withÂ `See all event details` selected.

3. If you're using a work email, you may seeÂ `Make available to team`Â as an option. This works too!

4. UnderÂ `Integrate calendar`, copy the URL in the box labeledÂ `Public URL to this calendar`:

5. Paste that URL into Notion and selectÂ `Create Embed`Â from the menu that appears.

## Manage your connected apps

As an individual user, you can manage your account authentications for connected apps at any time.

1. Go to `Settings` in the sidebar â†’ `Connections`. Here, you'll see all of the apps you've authenticated for link previews or embeds, as well as other apps that you haven't connected yet!

2. ClickÂ `Show all`Â at the top right to see additional app options.

3. For each app, you'll see several options: You canÂ `Connect`Â the app for the first time. This redirects you to the app, where you'll be able to authenticate the connection to Notion.

4. Once you've connected an account, it will show up below the app icon and name. Now, you canÂ `Connect another account`Â orÂ `Disconnect`Â an existing account.
