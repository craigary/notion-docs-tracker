## The basics

* To determine which tax and tax rate is applied to your Notion bill, we use your address. Notion's policy by jurisdiction is outlined in the Jurisdictions section below. If you are located in a jurisdiction not listed below, Notion will not charge you tax unless there is a change to tax law or other requirements that obligates us to do so.

* Notion uses your Tax Registration Number (TRN) to determine if a customer is a business or a consumer. In certain jurisdictions, businesses are tax-exempt. If Notion accepts your TRN and your billing address is in a jurisdiction where businesses are tax-exempt, we will not charge you tax unless there is a change to tax law or other requirements that obligates us to do so.

## Tax Registration Numbers

Notion collects Tax Registration Numbers (TRNs) associated with Value Added Tax (VAT) or Goods & Services Tax (GST) in certain countries to determine your status as a business or a consumer.

The TRN is also known as the Tax Identification Number (TIN), VAT Number, VAT ID, GST, or VAT Registration Number ‚Äî the format and name depends on the country.

Depending on your jurisdiction, if your TRN is accepted by Notion you may be exempt from your local tax.

Notion manages tax exemptions on a case by case basis. Please send your tax exemption request with your valid tax exemption certificate for the state(s) where you are located to email protected.
