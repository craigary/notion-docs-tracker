## Work together in real-time

You can edit the same page at the same time with an unlimited number of people.

* Their profile photos will show you where they're looking or working on the page.

* Edits and comments made by everyone will appear to you instantly.

* Click `🕘` at the top of the page to see who made what changes and when.

  * Content added is highlighted in blue.

  * Gray strikethrough shows what's been removed.

  * You can also see where people have left comments.

## Start a conversation

There are several ways to communicate with your teammates inside Notion — hopefully helping you cut down on meetings and status checks.

### Mention a teammate

Want to get someone's attention on a page?

1. Mention them by typing `@` followed by their name anywhere on a page.

2. You'll see a menu pop up that will search for the person in real time. Press `enter`.

   * They'll be notified of your mention with a link directly to it in their `Inbox` (or with a push notification if they are on the desktop or mobile app).

### Leave a comment

Comments let you attach your thoughts, questions, or opinions to specific content on a page.

* To leave a comment on a page, click the `Add comment` right above its title.

* To leave a comment on text, highlight it, and click `Comment` in the menu that pops up.

* To leave a comment on an image, embed, or other type of block, you can click the `•••` that appears at the top right or the `⋮⋮` icon that appears to the left on hover. Choose `Comment` from the menu that pops up. (You can also right click to bring it up!)

* You can @-mention your colleagues in comments to get their attention.

## Never miss a thing

Notion is built for asynchronous communication. You'll be notified if someone needs you or if a page you care about has been changed.

1. Click on `Inbox` at the top of your left sidebar. This is where we collect all notifications concerning you.

   * All updates will appear with a grey badge. If you've been mentioned, you'll see a red badge with the number of mentions waiting for you next to `Inbox`.

2. Click on any of these updates to go directly to the comment, mention, or edit in question.
