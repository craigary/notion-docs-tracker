**Note:** This feature is only available to users on the Enterprise Plan.

If your organization has multiple Enterprise workspaces, you can view and manage content across all of those workspaces in one place. Learn more about organization level controls [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls)

## Access content search

To go to content search for your workspace:

1. Go to `Settings` â†’ `Content search`.

2. Search for a page based on its ID, title, or content. You can also filter by created date, creator, and more.

Next to each page, youâ€™ll see:

* Where the page lives and whether itâ€™s [private, shared internally, shared externally, or shared to web](https://www.notion.com/help/audit-log#page-event-audience).

* The page creator, creation date, and who can access the page.

* Who last edited the page and when.

Workspace owners can also export this data as a .csv file.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x54;he `Audience` column will always list the most permissive group. If a page is shared with another team member, but also shared externally, the audience will read: `Shared externally`.

## Updating page permissions

As a workspace owner, you may need to unpublish a page or revoke permissions. Try using the Audience or Shared with filters to find pages that might be inappropriately shared. To change access to a restricted page:

1. Go to `Settings` â†’ `Content search`.

2. Select `â€¢â€¢â€¢`**&#x20;**&#x6E;ext to the pageâ€™s title.

3. Select `Change permissions`.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x55;sing this feature may provide workspace owners with access to the personal data of workspace members and guests. Please consult with your own legal counsel to obtain advice regarding privacy and data protection law&#x73;*.*
