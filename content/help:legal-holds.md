Legal holds allow your organization to preserve critical documents that may be needed for legal purposes.

Think of it as pressing a "pause" button— organization owners can place a user under hold and preserve all the docs they've created, edited, or viewed.

Legal holds help you:

* Preserve documents that may be needed for legal matters.

* Prevent accidental deletion of important files.

* Maintain document integrity during legal proceedings.

## Create legal holds

As an organization owner, access the [admin console](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls) and start a legal hold by following these steps:

1. You can do this by clicking your workspace name in the sidebar → `Manage organization`.

2. Under `Data & Compliance`, select `Legal holds`.

3. Click `Create hold`.

   * Give the hold a name and description.

   * Add users to the hold. You may select workspace owners, members, and guests. Any users removed after August 1, 2024, can also be added to the hold.

   * Select scope of the hold based on the user’s action:

     * Viewed, edited & created

     * Edited & created

     * Created only

4. Click `Create legal hold`.

## Export legal holds

Once the legal hold is created, follow these steps to view or export the preserved docs:

1. You can do this by clicking your workspace name in the sidebar → `Manage organization`.

2. Under `Data & Compliance`, select `Legal holds`.

3. Select the hold you’d like to export.

4. Under `Browse content`, select `Export hold`.

5. Select if you would like to export the page content as PDFs or the page metadata as a CSV, or both.

6. For the page metadata CSV, you will be sent an email link once the export is ready.

7. For the page content PDFs, navigate to `Exports` and select the download icon once the export has completed processing. These exports will be valid for 30 days.

## Manage & release legal holds

As an organization owner, access the [admin console](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls) to view, edit and release legal holds by following these steps:

1. You can do this by clicking your workspace name in the sidebar → `Manage organization`.

2. Under `Data & Compliance`, select `Legal holds`.

3. You’ll see a list of all your holds.

**From this view you can:**

* View and edit the details of legal holds.

* Browse and export held content.

* Release the legal hold, which will remove the users from this hold and reenable the retention settings for the pages being held.
