## Create a teamspace

### Create a new teamspace

Each workspace will have at least one teamspace that includes everyone, by default. To create an additional teamspace:

* Scroll to the Teamspaces label in your sidebar and click the `+` button to the right of the label.

* Give your teamspace a name, description, and icon.

* Choose the access settings for your teamspace. There are three options:

  * **Open:**¬†Anyone can join and view the content inside this teamspace.

  * **Closed:** Everyone can see that this teamspace exists, but can‚Äôt join unless they‚Äôre invited by an owner or member.

  * **Private (Business and Enterprise Plans only):** Only members or owners of this teamspace can invite other people, and it won‚Äôt be visible to people who are not added.

* Once you‚Äôve populated all of these fields, select `Create teamspace`.

### Turn an existing page into a teamspace

You can turn an existing page into a teamspace if:

* You have `Full access` to the existing page in question.

* The page is in a teamspace.

* The page is **not** a database page or a subpage within a database.

* You are a teamspace owner or workspace owner.

**Note:** Depending on your workspace settings, this action may be restricted to workspace owners only. You can check if this is the case by going to `Settings` ‚Üí `Teamspaces`.

To turn an existing page into a teamspace:

1. Hover over the page name and click the `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` button.

2. Choose the `Turn into teamspace` option.

## Add members to a teamspace

1. Next to the teamspace name in your sidebar, click the `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` button and then `Add members`.

2. In the menu that appears, search for a member or group to add to the teamspace. Then, choose whether you‚Äôd like them to be added as teamspace members or owners.

   * **Teamspace owners** will have full access to all pages within the teamspace by default. They will also have access to teamspace settings.

   * **Teamspace members** will receive access to pages within the teamspace as determined by teamspace owners. They will not have access to teamspace settings.

Toggle on the `Make default teamspace` option if you‚Äôd like every member of your workspace to be added to that teamspace by default. When you do this, all existing members in your workspace will be added right away, and all future members will be added when they join your workspace.

### **Adding with an invite link**

To add many members at once, it might be better to allow and post an invite link.

1. Click the `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` next to your teamspace and click on `Add members`.

2. Select `Copy invite link`.

**If you haven't already, you'll need to enable invite links:**

1. Click the `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` next to your teamspace and click on `Teamspace settings`.

2. Under `Security`, toggle on `Invite Link`.

**Tip:** Most likely, you‚Äôll only need one default teamspace, and we‚Äôd recommend no more than three default, even for large workspaces.

## Add or move pages to a teamspace

To add a new page to a teamspace:

1. Hover over the teamspace name in your sidebar.

2. Click the `+` button to add a new page within the teamspace.

To move an existing page to a teamspace:

1. Click the `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` at the top right of the page.

2. Click `Move to`, and you‚Äôll see a list of teamspaces that you can choose as destinations. You can also search for a specific teamspace.

## Modify teamspace settings

Each teamspace has its own membership, permissions, & security settings. These can be managed by the owners of a teamspace.

1. In your sidebar, hover over a teamspace name and click `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` to its right.

2. Click `Teamspace settings`.

In the pop-up menu, you‚Äôll see three tabs: General, Members, and Security. Below, we‚Äôll walk through all the options in each.

### General

Here, you can modify general teamspace information.

* Click the icon to change it, or upload your own image.

* Rename your teamspace.

* Add a description to your teamspace.

You can also archive your teamspace. This will remove it from the sidebar of every single teamspace member.

**Note:** Teamspace owners who are also workspace owners will be able to restore archived teamspaces in `Settings` ‚Üí `Teamspaces`.

### Members

In this tab, you can manage the membership of the teamspace.

* Toggle on the `Make default teamspace` option if you‚Äôd like to add every member of your workspace as teamspace members, all at once.

* Click `Add members` to search for workspace members or groups via name or email, then add them to the teamspace. You can also search via the option on the top right.

* Current teamspace members and groups will be listed in this tab. Their role (teamspace owner, member) will be shown to the right of their name.

  * Remove teamspace members by clicking the their role ‚Üí `Remove`.

* Teamspace owners can click any member or group‚Äôs role to change it.

If your workspace is on an Enterprise Plan, you‚Äôll see an additional option to set custom permissions on a member or group basis. [Learn more about permissions ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/sharing-and-permissions)

### Permissions

This tab outlines the permission levels of the teamspace and the users within.

* At the top are the general permissions of the teamspace. There are three options:

  * **Open:**¬†Anyone can join and view the content inside this teamspace.

  * **Closed:** Everyone can see that this teamspace exists, but can‚Äôt join unless they‚Äôre invited by an owner or member.

  * **Private (Business and Enterprise Plans only):** Only members or owners of this teamspace can invite other people, and it won‚Äôt be visible to people who are not added.

* Under that are permissions levels for this teamspace, split by each role: teamspace owners, teamspace members, and everyone else (including non-teamspace members) within the workspace.

* For closed or private teamspaces, teamspace owners can choose **who can invite teamspace members**: any teamspace member or teamspace owners only.

* For any teamspace, teamspace owners can choose **who can edit the teamspace sidebar**: any teamspace member or teamspace owners only.

### Security

**Note:** Some of the following settings are available on specific Notion plans only.

This tab shows the security settings for the teamspace. These will automatically inherit from the workspace‚Äôs security settings ‚Äî only **teamspace owners who are also workspace owners** will be able to modify them to make their teamspace settings more permissive than the workspace level settings.

**Available on all plans**

* Who can invite teamspace members
