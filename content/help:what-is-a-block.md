## Everything in Notion is a "block"

When you create your first page in Notion and begin typing, you've started with a text block. But Notion pages can contain a lot more than plain text!

Imagine every piece of content you add to a page â€” whether it's text, an image, or a table â€” as a single building block. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want.

Here's just one example page with different block types pointed out:

**Tip:&#x20;**&#x48;it theÂ `/`Â key on your keyboard (or tap theÂ `+`Â button above your keyboard if you're on mobile) to see all the different types of content you can add.

## Blocks can transform

Any block in Notion can be turned into any other type of block in order to use, view, or deepen that information in a new way.

Try this out by clicking theÂ `â‹®â‹®`Â symbol and choosingÂ `Turn into`Â to convert your block to something else!

## Blocks can be rearranged

TheÂ `â‹®â‹®` button can be used to drag and drop existing blocks. This makes it simple to rearrange, reorder, and reshape your thoughts with one motion.
