## Why use the desktop app?

Notion's desktop app is a clean, distraction-free interface without all the temptation of tabs. Switching between tabs in the desktop app is smooth and quick so that you can work more efficiently. You can even hover over a tab to preview the page inside it.

You'll receive push notifications in the desktop app when something important happens inside Notion, like when someone mentions you, someone assigns you a task, or you set a reminder for yourself.

### Open search when you create a new tab

Navigating to a new page is quick and easy in the desktop app. With Notion for desktop, you can set every new tab you create to open up a search window. From the search window that opens when you open a new tab, you can:

* Look for and quickly navigate to the page you want.

* Open a new page or start a chat with Notion AI in a new tab in just one click.

* Jump to an existing tab.

This setting will be turned on by default, but if you‚Äôd like to turn this off:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Preferences`.

2. Toggle off `Open Search when creating a new tab`. If this setting is toggled off, new tabs will display the default page specified in the `On Start up` setting.

### Command Search

On desktop, you can use search and [Notion AI](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-faqs) even when you‚Äôre outside of the Notion app. Trigger Command Search with a customizable keyboard shortcut, your menu bar on Mac, or your task bar on Windows so you can search or ask Notion AI without switching between windows or bringing the Notion desktop app to the foreground. To make it easier to access Notion this way, a few things will happen by default:

* Command Search will be turned on. To turn this off, go to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Preferences`. Toggle off `Use Command Search`. You can also turn off `Show Notion in Menu Bar` or customize your `Keyboard shortcut for Command Search`.

* Notion will be set to open at login. To turn this off:

  * On Mac: Right-click on the Notion icon in the dock ‚Üí select `Options` ‚Üí `Open at Login` to remove the check mark beside it.

  * On Windows: Right-click on the Notion icon in the task bar ‚Üí select `Launch Preferences` ‚Üí `Open Notion at Login` to remove the check mark beside it.

## If Notion links aren't automatically opening in the desktop app

If links to Notion pages aren't automatically opening in the desktop app, try following these steps:

1. Open the link in your browser.

2. Click `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` at the top right of the page. Scroll to the bottom of the menu that appears and click `Open in Mac app`.

## If the desktop app keeps opening automatically

If you‚Äôre on a Windows device and your Notion desktop app auto-launches from your browser, or Notion links keep opening in the desktop, make sure your Notion settings are adjusted so that your links are always opened in your browser.

To do this:

1. In the Notion desktop app, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Preferences`.

2. Toggle on `Open Notion links in browser`.

3. Go to `Settings` in Notion for web and toggle off `Open links in desktop app`.

If your Notion settings are already set up to open links in your web browser and the desktop app continues to open automatically, your device-level settings may be overriding your Notion settings. You can adjust these settings by following the instructions [here ‚Üí](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configure-startup-applications-in-windows-115a420a-0bff-4a6f-90e0-1934c844e473)
