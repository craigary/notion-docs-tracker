Wikis, page owners, and verified pages can help you centralize, find, and update knowledge with ease.

## Wikis

### Create a wiki

**Note:** At this time, only pages can be turned into wikis. You can’t turn a database into a wiki.

To turn a page into a wiki:

1. Select `•••` at the top of the page.

2. Select `Turn into wiki`.

Wikis come with three default views:

* `Home`: This view shows you all of the pages within the wiki. You can add any blocks to customize the page to your liking — for example, you could have a callout that explains what kind of pages the wiki contains, or which team owns the wiki. You could also organize your pages by creating headings, then dragging and dropping specific pages under those headings.

* `All pages`: This is a database view of all the pages within the wiki.

* `Pages I own`: This is a database view showing only the pages that you own.

You can create additional views with other layouts like a calendar, timeline, or list.

### Undo a wiki

If you no longer want a page to be a wiki:

1. Select `•••` at the top of the page.

2. Select `Undo wiki`.

## Verified pages and owners

You can verify content in your workspace to show that its contents are up to date. You can choose to keep a page verified for a certain period of time or indefinitely.

Verified pages will have a blue check mark next to their name when they’re @-mentioned, and when they’re displayed in Notion search results. When a page’s verification expires, its owner will be notified in their Notion inbox as well as via email.

### Verify pages in wikis

**Note:** By default, whoever creates a page in a wiki becomes the page’s owner, but you can change the page owner at any time.

To verify a page in a wiki:

1. Open a wiki page you own.

2. Click on the `Verification` section at the top.

3. Choose whether you want to verify the page until a specific time or indefinitely.

To verify a page from a database view in a wiki:

1. Select the verification property value for a page you own.

2. Choose whether you want to verify the page until a specific time or indefinitely.

Once verification expires, page owners will be notified to re-verify the page.

### Verify individual pages in your workspace

**Note:** This feature is only available for users on the Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.

You can verify pages that don’t belong to a wiki. To do this:

1. Open a page for which you have `Can edit` access or `Full access`.

2. Hover over the page name.

3. Select `Verify`.

4. Choose whether you want to verify the page until a specific time or indefinitely.

For a page to be verified, it must have at least one owner. To add owners to a verified page:

1. Open a page for which you have `Can edit` access or `Full access`.

2. Select `Verified` at the top.

3. Select `Owner`.

4. Add people from your workspace.

### Verify pages in a database

**Note:** This feature is only available for users on the Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.

While you can verify individual pages in a database following the instructions above, you can also add verification as a property to an entire database to verify all of the database’s pages.

To add verification to a database (not a wiki):

1. Select `•••` at the top of the database → `Properties` → `New property`.

2. Select `Verification`. This will automatically also add an `Owner` property to the database.

3. Select the verification property value for a page you have `Can edit` access or `Full access` to.

4. Choose whether you want to verify the page until a specific time or indefinitely.

By default, a page’s creator will also become its `Owner`. To change the settings for the `Owner` property:

1. Select `•••` at the top of the database → `Properties` → `Owner`.

2. Select `Limit` to decide if each database page should only have `1 Person` as the owner, or if there should be `No limit`.

3. Select `Default` to decide if the `Owner` for any new pages created in the database should be the person the page was `Created by`, or if there should be `No default`.

### Remove verification

To remove verification for a page in a wiki or an individual page:

1. At the top of the page, select `Verified`.

2. Select `Remove verification`.

To remove verification for page in a database with a verification property:

1. Select the verification property value for the page.

2. Select `Remove verification`.

### Manage all your verified pages

To see all of the verified pages in your workspace:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar.

2. Select `Verified pages`.

From here, you can search for a specific page, filter by owner or teamspace, and more.
