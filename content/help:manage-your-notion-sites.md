All workspace members can see and manage their workspace‚Äôs Notion Sites by going to `Settings` in their sidebar ‚Üí `Public pages`.

From here, workspace members can:

* See domains belonging to the workspace.

* See Notion Sites that they can access through a teamspace, group, parent page, or a direct invitation.

* See public forms and pages that anyone with a link can access.

* Go to the published Site, copy its URL, or open up the publishing settings for it.

Workspace owners can do all of the above, as well as [restrict the ability to publish Notion Sites](https://www.notion.com/help/workspace-settings#workspace-security) for their workspace.

## Manage your domains

![HC: Manage domains](https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/2amm8Lo3ozv9IgPqu42GRH/3b7e02504eef66ec49f20a797d467b35/Domains.png)

Looking to customize your Notion Site slug? To do this, open your published page in Notion, then select `Share` ‚Üí `Publish`. Click on your current slug, enter your preferred slug, and click `Save`. Learn more about custom slugs [here ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing#adjust-settings-for-your-notion-site)

### Create a new notion.site domain

**Note:&#x20;**&#x49;f you‚Äôre on a free plan, you can claim one `notion.site` domain. If you‚Äôre on a paid plan, you can claim up to five.

To customize and claim a new `notion.site` domain:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Public pages`.

2. Next to `Domains`, select `New domain`.

3. Select `Notion domain` ‚Üí `Continue`.

4. Enter your desired domain.

5. Select `Create domain`.

Once you've set your own workspace domain, it will be displayed at the start of any public page URLs, such as `acme.notion.site`. The unique `acme.notion.site` URL is **only used for publicly shared pages** from within your workspace. Internally, you will still see the URL as `notion.so/acme`.

**Note:**

* Notion reserves the right to reclaim a notion.site domain at any time, at its sole discretion.

* Once you set a custom notion.site domain, you‚Äôll need to continue to actively use your Notion workspace in order to maintain it. If you don‚Äôt, you might lose the domain.

* If you switch to a new custom notion.site domain, any existing links starting with the previous domain (`previousdomain.notion.site`) will no longer work! You'll need to re-share new links containing the new domain.

### Connect a custom domain

**Note:&#x20;**&#x54;his feature is only available on paid plans.

Workspace owners on paid plans can connect their existing custom domains with Notion Sites by purchasing the custom domain add-on. Notion doesn‚Äôt sell custom domains or replace your current domain provider ‚Äî the add-on allows you to use Notion Sites with a custom domain you already own. Learn more about this feature [here ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-a-custom-domain-with-notion-sites)

When you use a custom domain with Notion Sites, you‚Äôll also have the option to remove any Notion branding for that custom domain. Learn more about customizing your Sites in [this article ‚Üí](https://www.notion.com/help/edit-and-customize-your-notion-sites)

### Change or assign your domain's Homepage

**Note:&#x20;**&#x54;his feature is only available on paid plans.

To update the Homepage for a domain:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Public pages`.

2. Find the domain whose Homepage you want to update, then under `Homepage`:

   * If you don‚Äôt already have a Homepage assigned, select `Select a page`, then search for and select a page. Only pages that have already been [published](https://www.notion.com/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing) as a Notion Site under this domain will appear in this search.

   * If you already have a Homepage assigned but want to change it, select the pencil icon, then search for and select a page.

   * If you already have a Homepage assigned but want to clear it, select `X`.

### Update, validate, or delete a domain

To update, validate, or delete a domain:

1. Go to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Public pages`.

2. Next to your desired domain, select `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢`.

3. From here, select:

   * `Update` to change your `notion.site` domain name. Any changes will apply to all of your live Notion Sites associated with this domain. Enter a new name and select `Save changes`. If you‚Äôre trying to update your custom domain name, you‚Äôll have to delete the existing one and add a custom domain again, using the correct name.

   * `Delete` to remove your domain. If any Notion Sites have been published to the domain you‚Äôre trying to delete, you‚Äôll be asked to unpublish those Sites before proceeding.

   * `Validate` to verify your custom domain.

**Note:**

* If your domain has a flag next to it in your Sites settings, you won‚Äôt be able to delete it. This is because it‚Äôs the default domain of your workspace that was created when your workspace was created.

* When you delete a custom domain, you'll still be able to use it with Notion Sites until the end of your current billing cycle. After that time, you will no longer be charged for that custom domain.

## Manage your published pages

Go to `Settings` in your sidebar ‚Üí `Public pages` to see which of your Notion pages have been published as Notion Sites. From here, you can:

* Select `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` next to each published page to view the page, copy its link, or go into its [publishing settings](https://www.notion.com/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing#adjust-settings-for-your-notion-site).
