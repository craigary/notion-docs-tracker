## Duplicate a page

Let's say you come across a Notion page you love on the web and want to make it your own.

1. Log into Notion on your browser.

2. Navigate to the public page and clickÂ `Duplicate`Â in its upper right corner.

3. Choose the workspace you'd like to duplicate the page into from the dropdown.

4. Your browser will take you to that page, now duplicated into theÂ `Private`Â section of your sidebar. It will include all the sub-pages contained in the original page.

5. You can edit this page and its sub-pages just like you would any other.

**Note:** After youâ€™ve duplicated a page to your workspace, you might see some blocks that say `No access`. These blocks are most likely not intended to be duplicated, and you can delete them from your workspace.

## Prevent duplication

If you have a public page that you don't want duplicated, you can turn that option off.

1. Open `Share` at the top of your published Notion page â†’ `Publish` â†’ `Site customization`.

2. Select `Header`.

3. Toggle off `Duplicate as template`.

4. Select `Publish changes` at the top of the screen.
