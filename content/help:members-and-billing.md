Notion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.

## Members vs. guests

Before you add someone to your workspace as a member, remember that **adding members to a paid Notion workspace is a billable action and will incur additional charges on your invoice**.

If you donâ€™t want to add a new member to your workspace but would like to collaborate with people via Notion, you can invite **guests** to specific Notion **pages** instead, provided you havenâ€™t met [your planâ€™s guest limit](https://www.notion.com/pricing). Guests get access at the page level and are more limited in what they can do in a Notion workspace. Learn more about members and guests [here â†’](https://www.notion.com/help/whos-who-in-a-workspace)

To avoid accidentally adding members to your workspace, go to the Notion page you want to invite a guest to, select `Share` at the top of that page, and after you enter their email address, hover over their email address to confirm that theyâ€™re being added as a guest before you select `Invite`.

Youâ€™ll be asked if youâ€™d like to upgrade the guest to a member â€” select `Skip for now` to ensure that theyâ€™ll be added to that page at no cost.

## Adding members to your workspace

### On a monthly plan

When you add members to your workspace on a monthly plan, you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval.

### On a yearly plan

When you add members to your workspace on a yearly plan, you'll receive an invoice at the **next month** mark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:

* The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.

* Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.

## Removing members from a workspace

When you remove members from your workspace, **you have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your current billing interval. You can add new members before the end of your current billing interval to fill these seats at no additional charge.**

At the end of your billing interval, weâ€™ll recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.
