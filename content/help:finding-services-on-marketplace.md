## Hire a partner

* You can browse our directory of consulting partners and reach out to discuss working together. Consultants can help with workspace setup, migrations, integrations, custom templates, training, and more.

* To reach out to a potential Consulting Partner, you must complete a form to provide more information about your project. They can accept or reject your invitation based on fit and availability. If they accept, they'll provide a booking link for a discovery call.

## Working with a partner

* If you decide to engage with a Consulting Partner, you can work with them directly. They will likely register the deal with Notion, and you‚Äôll be asked to confirm that you're working together.

* At the end of the engagement, you'll receive an email with a satisfaction survey and a request to review the consultant. Please leave a review ‚Äî your feedback will help other people find the best partner for their project!
